The strong function of computational tools in some aspect is superior to that of human brains. It is the application of such strong function that changes the face of human society. At the same time, it presents new methods for scientific research and new perspective for solving problems, promotes human thinking to a higher level, and presents new means for people to understand and change the world. The advantage of computational tools over human brains is the speed, while the initiative ability of human brains is not owned by computational tools. Perfect combination of thinking and computing gives birth to a series of achievements, and lays the foundation of science.","","978-1-4244-3581-4","10.1109/ETCS.2009.120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4958823","computational tools;computational thinking;computational methods","Humans;Computer science;Biology computing;Computer science education;Educational technology;Technological innovation;History;Evolution (biology);Computational intelligence;Face","","3","","6","IEEE","26 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We adopt the formal teaching model and learning model, incremental expression of computational thinking ability to improve the effect, from the computational thinking of automation, abstract characteristics of the teaching and learning model based on computational thinking formalization. Then, in the case study, the learning support technology scheme of MOOC course platform combining mobile terminal and HTML5 is designed. Through teaching practice and quantitative analysis of experimental behavior, the platform effectively avoids the interference of programming language code, which simplifies the expression and application process of algorithm thinking, and enhances students' interest and operation of programming working ability.","","978-1-7281-8666-5","10.1109/ICICTA51737.2020.00063","Guangdong Province “Research and Practical Exploration on the Reform of Computer Basic Teaching Mode Combined with Innovation Ability and Computational Thinking”(grant numbers:20191206); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9526726","computational thinking;practice analysis;computer basic teaching;HTML;MOOC","Computer languages;Computer aided instruction;Automation;Electronic learning;Codes;Statistical analysis;Computational modeling","","1","","8","IEEE","13 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Three of these approaches are Mathematical Thinking, Abstract Thinking, and Computational Thinking. Each approach tries to clarify areas of CS that are not directly tied to writing computer programs. In a separate line of research, the current authors have been examining different ways to teach mathematics to CS students. We developed a Computational Math scale that measures the level of problem-solving gestalt exhibited by textbook authors. In this study, we relate our Computational Math framework to current research on Mathematical, Abstract, and Computational (MAC) Thinking. We counted words used frequently in research articles and compared them to words that form the Computational Math scale. Our results suggest an overall MAC Thinking framework that integrates a wide range of topics relevant to computing and programming.","2377-634X","978-1-4244-6262-9","10.1109/FIE.2010.5673139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5673139","Abstraction;Algorithm;Computational Math;Model;Thinking","Computers;Computational modeling;Programming profession;Books;Mathematical model","","10","","25","IEEE","23 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The research methodology uses the ADDIE model by driving game-based learning activities and promoting students with computational thinking skills, including decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm design. The statistical methods used to analyze the data were mean, standard deviation, and t-test. The study's findings revealed that 1) the students' computational thinking skills improved significantly after engaging in game-based learning activities, demonstrating statistical significance at the.05 level, and 2) the overall students' satisfaction after activities with game-based learning was averaged at the highest level (= 4.75, S.D. = 0.52).","","979-8-3503-6597-9","10.1109/iSTEM-Ed62750.2024.10663178","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10663178","computational thinking skills;game-based learning;learning activity","Statistical analysis;Computational modeling;Education;Pattern recognition;Standards","","","","20","IEEE","6 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results indicated three main categories of computational thinking: decomposition, abstraction, and simulation. The implementation of project-based learning can develop students’ computational thinking skills. Students are trained to solve physics problems analytically and precisely in structured and logical thinking through a project. This research is expected to be the information for physics teachers to integrate computational thinking in the classroom as a 21st-century learning skill.","2770-4807","978-1-6654-9214-0","10.1109/ICET56879.2022.9990631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9990631","computational thinking;physics classroom;project-based learning","Computational modeling;Education;Problem-solving;Interviews;Physics;Portfolios","","3","","34","IEEE","23 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
