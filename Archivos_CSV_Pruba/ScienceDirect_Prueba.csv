YOUJUN2024101624,Relieving negative Chinese transfer in EFL syntactic writing through negative feedback based on computational thinking,Thinking Skills and Creativity,53,101624,2024,1871-1871,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsc.2024.101624,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187124001627,Tang Youjun and Ma Xiaomei,"Negative Chinese transfer, EFL syntactic writing, Computational thinking, Negative feedback, Interventionist group dynamic assessment","Negative feedback can temporarily relieve negative Chinese transfer (NCT) in English as a foreign language (EFL) syntactic writing by focusing only on the surface writing constructs, neglecting that EFL writing is an embodiment of the process by which higher-order thinking operates. To solve the problem, the researchers conducted a pretest, interventionist group dynamic assessment (IGDA) in the form of negative feedback based on computational thinking (CT), higher-order thinking, and post-test quasi-experimental design, with a control group receiving the direct correction feedback instructing model to mitigate the NCT in EFL syntactic writing. We analyzed the syntactic writing types and frequencies of the NCT obtained through repeated-measure ANOVA and confirmed by qualitative data through video recording. The results indicated that IGDA in the form of negative feedback based on CT principal skills could (1) significantly decrease syntactic writing errors caused by the NCT, (2) improve learners’ EFL writing performance, and finally, (3) elevate the computer as an essential mediation tool. This innovative instructing mode of intervening with writing constructs and higher-order thinking and bringing about deeper thinking and creativity contributes to the EFL writing teaching methodology in a foreign language higher education."

In this sense, it is essential to highlight the emergence of new competencies and skills in education due to technological advancements. Legislative frameworks have been developed to incorporate digital literacy, access to robotics, and computational thinking, between others. Hence, this review and meta-analysis aim at identifying the influence of robotics activities on computational thinking through a PRISMA-guided review. The findings reveal that interventions conducted in early childhood education significantly impact computational thinking. Results also showcase that, despite perceived barriers related to technology accessibility, the presence of legislation and contexts prioritizing these competencies is more relevant than the digital access gap."
ZURNACI2024101576,Educational robotics or unplugged coding activities in kindergartens?: Comparison of the effects on pre-school children's computational thinking and executive function skills,Thinking Skills and Creativity,53,101576,2024,1871-1871,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsc.2024.101576,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187124001147,Burcu Zurnacı and Zeynep Turan,"Unplugged coding, Robotic coding, Educational robot, Pre-school education, Computational thinking, Executive function","This study compares the effects of coding education with educational robot and unplugged coding activities on pre-school students' computational thinking and executive function skills. This study used a pre-test and post-test comparison group quasi-experimental design. The study was conducted in a public kindergarten with 48 pre-school students (24 educational robot- BeeBot® group and 24-unplugged coding group) aged 5-6. The TechCheck-K test was used to measure computational thinking skills, and Executive Functions Battery-Computerized Touch was used to measure executive function skills. The process started with pre-test applications and ended with post-tests after four weeks (16 different sessions) of the implementation in both groups. The study found a statistically significant difference between the computational thinking pre-test and post-test scores of pre-school students in both groups in favor of the post-test. It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the educational robot group between the post-test scores of computational thinking skills. In addition, when the findings regarding executive functions were evaluated, there was a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of total executive function in favor of the post-test in both groups. However, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of both groups in terms of total executive function skills scores. In addition, when the post-test scores of pre-school students in two groups were evaluated, it was determined that there was no significant difference in computational thinking and executive function skills according to gender. Consequently, it was determined that coding education with an educational robot was more effective for gaining computational thinking skills than unplugged coding activities for pre-school students. However, it was observed that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the development of executive function skills in pre-school education."
LI2024101537,Engagement predicts computational thinking skills in unplugged activity: Analysis of gender differences,Thinking Skills and Creativity,52,101537,2024,1871-1871,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsc.2024.101537,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187124000750,Qi Li and Qiang Jiang and Jyh-Chong Liang and Weiyan Xiong and Wei Zhao,"Engagement, Computational thinking skills, Gender differences, Unplugged activity, Partial least squares–structural equation","Engagement is critical to computational thinking and programming education. However, as multi-dimensional variables, when analyzing how different aspects of engagement in computational thinking tasks influence skills development, it becomes crucial to discern precisely which engagement components intersect with the progression of computational thinking skills. This discernment is pivotal because engagement can vary based on the task nature, the context, and the individual's preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the gender differences in engagement and computational thinking skills and the predictive relationships among these sub-dimensions for boys and girls in an unplugged environment. In this study, a quasi-experiment for 90 sixth-grade students from a north Chinese primary school was performed. By partial least squares–structural equation modeling, students’ models of computational thinking skills and engagement were analyzed, and comparisons of boys and girls were made by analysis of covariance statistics. Results indicated that compared with boys, girls reported higher computational thinking performance and more engagement in unplugged contexts. Furthermore, girls’ computational thinking skills were only predicted by their cognitive engagement, whereas boys’ computational thinking skills were predicted by their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Teachers can adopt these findings to design computational thinking teaching interventions that combine the advantages of unplugged activity and focus on the engagement of boys and girls."

Thus, this cross-sectional study examines the predictors of such thinking by specifically focusing on the roles of perceived creativity, creative self-efficacy, and computational thinking. The participants consisted of 896 secondary school students (52.9 % female; 47.1 % male) in Indonesia who were asked to complete a series of online questionnaires and tests. For analysis, structural equation modeling was employed, demonstrating satisfactory construct validity and instrument reliability. Based on the results, there was a positive association between computational thinking and mathematical creative thinking. In addition, perceived creativity had a positive impact on mathematical creative thinking, whereas creative self-efficacy showed a negative association. As for the empirical model, it revealed that computational thinking plays a mediating role, connecting perceived creativity and creative self-efficacy to mathematical creative thinking. The findings suggest that incorporating these skills and related variables into the mathematics curriculums in schools is essential for preparing students for success in the 21st century."
