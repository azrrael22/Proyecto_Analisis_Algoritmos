In this study, we analyze two validated instruments for assessing computational thinking - the CTt (Computational Thinking Test) and the CTS (Computational Thinking Scale). The study involved 49 students in grades 8 and 9 (age 14–16). Prior to the study, students in both grades were taught computational thinking differently. One group learned computational thinking by completing tasks and creating projects in Scratch, the other group learned by completing tasks in “Minecraft: Education Edition”. The students were asked to take the CTt and CTS tests. The nature of these tests is different, one is computational thinking diagnostic tool, the other is a psychometric self-assessment test consisting of core abilities (subconstructs) important for computational thinking. The aim of this study was to determine how these tests related to each other and whether students’ gender and the different tools chosen to teach computational thinking had an impact on the level of computational thinking knowledge and abilities acquired based on the tests. The results have shown that the scores of the two tests correlated with each other only for male students’ subgroup. For a whole group CTt scores correlated only with CTS algorithmic thinking subconstruct. The results have also shown that teaching tools do have an impact on the acquisition of different computational thinking concepts skills: students taught with different tools had different test results. This study provides useful implications on computational thinking teaching improvement and its assessment better understanding. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Assessment; Computational thinking; Computational thinking assessment instruments; CTS; CTt; Gender differences; Learning tools","Diagnosis; Learning systems; Assessment; Assessment instruments; Computational thinking assessment instrument; Computational thinking scale; Computational thinking test; Computational thinkings; Gender-differences; Learning tool; Students","V.

It is widely agreed that in order to benefit and thrive in a digital world, more than digital literacy is required. Computational thinking promises understanding of information technology and its utilization without necessarily knowing how to write code. According to many authors, skills in computational thinking include the ability to evaluate and design solutions to problems. However, the vision for computational thinking, laid out by a number of scholars, is even bigger than this. It proposes that thinking habits from computer science are beneficial for any kind of problem solving and that those thinking habits form a central part of modern sciences. It might be that components of computational thinking are indeed useful in problem solving and that they play an important part in other sciences. However, computer science combines three types of thinking traditions: theoretical (mathematical) tradition, engineering tradition and scientific tradition, and it is important to differentiate between what is an aspect in one or more of these traditions and what is unique for computer science. This clarification will support the application and teaching of computational thinking. This paper explores the uniqueness of computational thinking and its roots in theoretical, engineering and scientific traditions of computing. © 42nd International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics, MIPRO 2019 - Proceedings.

However, the existing computational thinking assessments still suffer from the problem of insufficient examination of non-cognitive factors, leading to the lack of validity of its assessment results. Since the iceberg model can comprehensively and deeply explore individual characteristics, this paper draws on the division idea of the model and divides computational thinking into explicit computational thinking the basic knowledge required to solve problems using computational thinking and implicit computational thinking the internal psychological characteristics of individuals in the process of using computational thinking. A comprehensive assessment framework of computational thinking is constructed, which contains five dimensions: knowledge and skills, self-efficacy, internet attitude, learning motivation, and thinking style. Finally, its application in the hierarchical teaching of computational thinking and suggestions for personalized teaching programs are given in order to promote the development of personalized education in computational thinking. © 2023 IEEE.","assessment framework; computational thinking; computational thinking assessment; computational thinking education; iceberg model","Sea ice; Assessment framework; Cognitive factors; Computational thinking assessment; Computational thinking education; Computational thinkings; Iceberg modelling; Individual characteristics; Psychological characteristics; Application programs","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Kogakuin University; The Hong Kong Polytechnic University","5th International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Education, WAIE 2023","28 September 2023 through 30 September 2023","Tokyo","198962","","979-835030706-1","","","English","Proc. - Int.

Presenting the distinguished and exemplary works by educators and researchers in the field highlighting the contemporary trends and issues, creative and unique approaches, innovative methods, frameworks, pedagogies and theoretical and practical aspects in computational thinking. A decade ago the notion of computational thinking was introduced by Jeannette Wing and envisioned that computational thinking will be a fundamental skill that complements to reading, writing and arithmetic for everyone and represents a universally applicable attitude. The computational thinking is considered a thought processes involved in a way of solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behaviour. Assimilating computational thinking at young age will assist them to enhance problem solving skills, improve logical reasoning, and advance analytical ability - key attributes to succeed in the 21st century. Educators around the world are investing their relentless effort in equipping the young generation with real-world skills ready for the demand and challenges of the future. It is commonly believed that computational thinking will play a pivotal and dominant role in this endeavour. Wide-ranging research on and application of computational thinking in education have been emerged in the last ten years. This book will document attempts to conduct systematic, prodigious and multidisciplinary research in computational thinking and present their findings and accomplishments. Computational Thinking is regarded as an essential literacy for learners in the 21st century. While computing is becoming compulsory in many schools worldwide, rigorous theoretical foundations and empirical research on computational thinking are scarce. This volume is an essential guide which brings together many of the world’s leading scholars to describe and explore concepts and approaches beneficial for researchers and practitioners alike. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Coding and computational thinking; Computational thinking education; Computational thinking STEM; Computer science education; Critical thinking; Learning in school; Problem solving skills; School curriculum; Scratch programming; STEM classroom; Teacher education; Teaching early childhood; Transformative pedagogy; Visual block programming","","","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","","978-331993566-9; 978-331993565-2","","","English","Computational Think. in the STEM Disciplines: Foundations and Research Highlights","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063514033"

Recognizing students' computational thinking stages in game-based learning environments is essential to capture unproductive learning and provide appropriate scaffolding. However, few reliable and valid computational thinking measures have been developed, especially in games, where computational knowledge acquisition and computational skill construction are implicit. This study introduced an innovative approach to explore students' implicit computational thinking through various explicit factors in game-based learning, with a specific focus on Zoombinis, a logical puzzle-based game designed to enhance students' computational thinking skills. Our results showed that factors such as duration, accuracy, number of actions and puzzle difficulty were significantly related to students' computational thinking stages, while gender and grade level were not. Besides, findings indicated gameplay performance has the potential to reveal students' computational thinking stages and skills. Effective performance (shorter duration, fewer actions and higher accuracy) indicated practical problem-solving strategies and systematic computational thinking stages (eg, Algorithm Design). This work helps simplify the process of implicit computational thinking assessment in games by observing the explicit factors and gameplay performance. These insights will serve to enhance the application of gamification in K-12 computational thinking education, offering a more efficient method to understanding and fostering students' computational thinking skills. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Game-based learning is a pedagogical framework for developing computational thinking in K-12 education. Computational thinking assessment in games faces difficulties because students' knowledge acquisition and skill construction are implicit. Qualitative methods have widely been used to measure students' computational thinking skills in game-based learning environments. What this paper adds Categorize students' computational thinking experiences into distinct stages and analyse recurrent patterns employed at each stage through sequential analysis. This approach serves as inspiration for advancing the assessment of stage-based implicit learning with machine learning methods. Gameplay performance and puzzle difficulty significantly relate to students' computational thinking skills. Researchers and instructors can assess students' implicit computational thinking by observing their real-time gameplay actions. High-performing students can develop practical problem-solving strategies and exhibit systematic computational thinking stages, while low-performing students may need appropriate interventions to enhance their computational thinking practices. Implications for practice and/or policy Introduce a practical method with the potential for generalization across various game-based learning to better understand learning processes by analysing significant correlations between certain gameplay variables and implicit learning stages. Allow unproductive learning detection and timely intervention by modelling the reflection of gameplay variables in students' implicit learning processes, helping improve knowledge mastery and skill construction in games. Further investigations on the causal relationship between gameplay performance and implicit learning skills, with careful consideration of more performance factors, are expected. © 2024 British Educational Research Association.","computational thinking assessment; data science applications; game-based learning analytics; implicit computational thinking behaviours; learning behaviour patterns","Computer aided instruction; Data Science; Knowledge acquisition; Scaffolds; Behaviour patterns; Computational thinking assessment; Computational thinkings; Data science application; Game-based Learning; Game-based learning analytic; Implicit computational thinking behavior; Learning behavior; Learning behavior pattern; Science applications; Students","T.
