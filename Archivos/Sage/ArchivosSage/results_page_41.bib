abstract = {All operations in process metallurgy involve complex phenomena comprising momentum, heat, and/or mass transport; iron- and steelmaking is not an exception. Transport phenomena, i.e. fluid flows, heat transfer and mass transfer, play a dominant role in process metallurgy since their respective laws govern the kinetics of the various physical phenomena occurring in ironmaking and in steelmaking. These phenomena include such events as three-phase reactions, entrainment of slag and gas in liquid steel, vacuum degassing, alloy melting and mixing, the movements and flotation of inclusions, melt temperature losses, residence times in a metallurgical reactor, erosion of refractory linings, etc. In all these aspects, the evolution in our techniques and abilities to model single and multiphase flows and their attendant heat and mass transfer processes has contributed significantly to our understanding and effectively operating these processes, to designing improvements, and to developing new processes. To be ignorant of these matters can doom a processing operation to the scrap heap of metallurgical failures. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational heat and mass transfer has been a very effective tool over the last three decades, for modelling iron- and steelmaking processes, starting from the blast furnace up to continuous casting and beyond. With the advent of commercial CFD packages and ever increasing computational power through parallel processing, CFD has now become the dominant approach for predicting various aspects in iron- and steelmaking processes. In Part 1 of this review paper, the applications of CFD in ironmaking processes are thoroughly reviewed, discussed and critiqued. In Part 2, fluid flows and CFD in steelmaking and steel casting processes are similarly reviewed and critiqued.}

abstract = {Background Past studies reported a low correlation between rhinomanometry and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but the source of the discrepancy was unclear. Low correlation or lack of correlation has also been reported between subjective and objective measures of nasal patency. Objective: This study investigates (1) the correlation and agreement between nasal resistance derived from CFD (RCFD) and rhinomanometry (RRMN), and (2) the correlation between objective and subjective measures of nasal patency. Methods Twenty-five patients with nasal obstruction underwent anterior rhinomanometry before and after mucosal decongestion with oxymetazoline. Subjective nasal patency was assessed with a 0-10 visual analog scale (VAS). CFD simulations were performed based on computed tomography scans obtained after mucosal decongestion. To validate the CFD methods, nasal resistance was measured in vitro (REXPERIMENT) by performing pressure-flow experiments in anatomically accurate plastic nasal replicas from 6 individuals. Results Mucosal decongestion was associated with a reduction in bilateral nasal resistance (0.34 ± 0.23 Pa.s/ml to 0.19 ± 0.24 Pa.s/ml, p = 0.003) and improved sensation of nasal airflow (bilateral VAS decreased from 5.2 ± 1.9 to 2.6 ± 1.9, p < 0.001). A statistically significant correlation was found between VAS in the most obstructed cavity and unilateral airflow before and after mucosal decongestion (r = −0.42, p = 0.003). Excellent correlation was found between RCFD and REXPERIMENT (r = 0.96, p < 0.001) with good agreement between the numerical and in vitro values (RCFD/REXPERIMENT = 0.93 ± 0.08). A weak correlation was found between RCFD and RRMN (r = 0.41, p = 0.003) with CFD underpredicting nasal resistance derived from rhinomanometry (RCFD/RRMN = 0.65 ± 0.63). A stronger correlation was found when unilateral airflow at a pressure drop of 75 Pa was used to compare CFD with rhinomanometry (r = 0.76, p < 0.001). Conclusion CFD and rhinomanometry are moderately correlated, but CFD underpredicts nasal resistance measured in vivo due in part to the assumption of rigid nasal walls. Our results confirm previous reports that subjective nasal patency correlates better with unilateral than with bilateral measurements and in the context of an intervention.}

abstract = {The mixture formation and combustion process of a hydrogen direct-injection internal combustion engine is computed using a modified version of a commercial three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics code. The aim of the work is the evaluation of hydrogen laminar flame speed correlations and turbulent flame speed closures with respect to combustion of premixed and stratified mixtures at various levels of air-to-fuel equivalence ratio. Heat-release rates derived from in-cylinder pressure traces are used for the validation of the combustion simulations. A turbulent combustion model with closures for a turbulent flame speed is investigated. The value of the computed heat-release rates mainly depends on the quality of laminar burning velocities and standard of turbulence quantities provided to the combustion model. Combustion simulations performed with experimentally derived laminar flame speed data give better results than those using laminar flame speeds obtained from a kinetic scheme. However, experimental data of hydrogen laminar flame speeds found in the literature are limited regarding the range of pressures, temperatures and air-to-fuel equivalence ratios, and do not comply with the demand of high-pressure engine-relevant conditions.}

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most important diagnostic tools in modern medicine. Since it is a high-cost and highly-complex imaging modality, computational models are frequently built to enhance its understanding as well as to support further development. However, such models often have to be simplified to complete simulations in a reasonable time. Thus, the simulations with high spatial/temporal resolutions, with any motion consideration (like blood flow) and/or with 3D objects usually call for using parallel computing environments. In this paper, we propose to use graphics processing units (GPUs) for fast simulations of MRI of vascular structures. We apply a CUDA environment which supports general purpose computation on GPU (GPGPU). The data decomposition strategy is applied and thus the parts of each virtual object are spread over the GPU cores. The GPU cores are responsible for calculating the influence of blood flow behavior and MRI events after successive time steps. In the proposed approach, different data layouts, memory access patterns, and other memory improvements are applied to efficiently exploit GPU resources. Computational performance is thoroughly validated for various vascular structures and different NVIDIA GPUs. Results show that MRI simulations can be accelerated significantly thanks to GPGPU. The proposed GPU-based approach may be easily adopted in the modeling of other flow related phenomena like perfusion, diffusion or transport of contrast agents.}

abstract = {A combined experimental-computational approach is used for the analysis of hygrothermal performance of a brick wall provided with interior thermal insulation system. A 2D laboratory experiment is performed to determine temperature and moisture fields in a characteristic segment of the envelope over a sufficiently long period including cold winter months. Then, a computational model of moisture and heat transport is developed, using an integral two-phase balance equation capable of distinguishing between the particular phases of water and an enthalpy-based heat balance equation. A 2D computational representation of the experiment is used for model calibration and identification of unknown parameters, resulting in a very good agreement of experimental and calculated fields, with R2 between 0.9687 and 0.9888. The calibrated model is subsequently used for a long-term hygrothermal assessment of the studied detail to demonstrate the functionality of the interior thermal insulation system, as well as the applicability of the developed model.}

abstract = {The concept of ‘digital phenotyping’ was originally developed by researchers in the mental health field, but it has travelled to other disciplines and areas. This commentary draws upon our experiences of working in two scientific projects that are based at the University of Oxford’s Big Data Institute – The RADAR-AD project and The Minerva Initiative – which are developing algorithmic phenotyping technologies. We describe and analyse the concepts of digital biomarkers and computational phenotyping that underlie these projects, explain how they are linked to other research in digital phenotyping and compare and contrast some of their epistemological and ethical implications. In particular, we argue that the phenotyping paradigm in both projects is grounded on an assumption of ‘objectivity’ that is articulated in different ways depending on the role that is given to the computational/digital tools. Using the concept of ‘affordance’, we show how specific functionalities relate to potential uses and social implications of these technologies and argue that it is important to distinguish among them as the concept of digital phenotyping is increasingly being used with a variety of meanings.}

abstract = {There has been a continued expansion of the uses of computer-based tools and techniques in public sector endeavors: from traditional notions of data collection and management (bean counting) to the processing of data into information that supports managerial activities. Advances in technology based on emerging work in decision theory, information science, and cognitive science will allow for use of these computational models in more expansive “advisory” roles to decision makers of all types. To what degree can public sector decision makers use computational models to support or advise decision making? As these new technologies become a routine part of the policy process, will a belief in computer omnipotence tempt public sector decision makers to abdicate personal responsibility for poor choices? The authors explore the choice-related implications associated with the increased use of computer-based models, define possible computer-based decision support models (CBDSMs), and present a typology of credible uses of CBDSMs.}

Data from simulations of the model were compared with the behavior of 32 undergraduate students performing a scheduling task under various within-subject manipulations and across time. Correlational analyses indicated that the model accounted for most of the participants’data, with coefficients between the model and each participant’s behavior mostly in the high 90s.}

abstract = {Mesh partitioning is significant to the efficiency of parallel computational fluid dynamics simulations. The most time-consuming parts of parallel computational fluid dynamics simulations are iteratively solving linear systems derived from partial differential equation discretizations. This article aims at mesh partitioning for better iterative convergence feature of this procedure. For typical computational fluid dynamics simulations in which partial differential equations are discretized and solved after the mesh is partitioned, numerical information of the linear systems is not available yet during mesh partitioning. We propose to construct approximations for matrix elements and theoretically find out that for finite-volume-based problems, the face area can approximate the corresponding matrix element well. A mesh partitioning scheme using the matrix value approximations for better iterative convergence behavior is implemented and numerically testified. The results show that our method can capture the most important factor influencing the matrix values and achieve partitions with good performance throughout the simulations with non-uniform meshes. The novel partitioning strategy is general and easy to implement in various partitioning packages.}

abstract = {Since its inception, computational social science (CSS) has been characterized as an interdisciplinary field. Nevertheless, unlike a mature interdisciplinary field that duly integrates knowledge beyond disciplinary boundaries, CSS has arguably been fragmented into multiple lines of inquiry. Although such fragmentation has been a constant concern, limited empirical evidence exists to substantiate any degree of integration in research on CSS. To systematically map the landscape of research on CSS, we examined the dynamic topology of the bibliometric network of CSS during the past 20 years. By comparing the structure of the coupling network and the co-subject network with three prototypical network models that we simulated—the centralized model, the fragmented model, and the cohesive model—our analysis revealed that the citation networks of research on CSS are highly centralized but less fragmented than often assumed. Beyond that, a driving factor shaping the coupling network’s cohesive structure is the citation to high-impact articles. Those and other findings contribute to current understandings of the process of integration in the evolution of disciplines.}
