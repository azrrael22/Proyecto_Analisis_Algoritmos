abstract = {This article sheds light on the emerging forms of cultural capital that media practitioners need to acquire to work with automated news, as in Bourdieu’s understanding of unique abilities that include, among others, journalistic expertise and technical know-how. To uncover these new skills, we carried out 30 interviews with editorial staff, executives and technologists working at 23 media organisations based in Europe, North America and Australia. We show that these new forms of cultural capital are essentially two-fold: on the one hand, they involve taking a “structured journalism” approach so as to think of what an ideal story may look like, and then by breaking it down into smaller predictable elements that can be reusable across many versions of that same story; on the other hand, they also call for knowing how to embed a media organisation’s standards and practices into code for automated news. Overall this study argues that a new type of cultural capital emerges, as it is associated with the production of automated news. We call it the distinct-abstract capital, whereby journalism is thought of both as a one-off endeavour and as a process that can be deconstructed in an abstract way close to computer programming.}

abstract = {Computational modeling holds significant promise as a tool for improving how theory is developed, expressed, and used to inform empirical research and evaluation efforts. However, the knowledge and skillsets needed to build computational models are rarely developed in the training received by social and organizational scientists. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide an accessible introduction to and reference for building computational models to represent theory. We first discuss important principles and recommendations for “thinking about” theory and developing explanatory accounts in ways that facilitate translating their core assumptions, specifications, and ideas into a computational model. Next, we address some frequently asked questions related to building computational models that introduce several fundamental tasks/concepts involved in building models to represent theory and demonstrate how they can be implemented in the R programming language to produce executable model code. The accompanying supplemental materials describes additional considerations relevant to building and using computational models, provides multiple examples of complete computational model code written in R, and an interactive application offering guided practice on key model-building tasks/concepts in R.}

abstract = {Fostering students’ computer programming skills has become an important educational issue in the globe. However, it remains a challenge for students to understand those abstract concepts when learning computer programming, implying the need to provide instant learning diagnosis and feedback in computer programming activities. In this study, a Two-Tier Test-Based Programming Training (T3PT) approach was proposed. Accordingly, an online learning system was developed to provide students with precision feedback for guiding them to identify misconceptions of computer programming to improve their computer programming learning achievement. In order to examine the effects of the proposed approach, a learning system was developed and a quasi-experiment was conducted. Two classes of 99 eighth-grade students from Taiwan were divided into an experimental group and a control group. The students in the experimental group used the learning system based on the T3PT approach, while the control group used the conventional learning system. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach was significantly superior to the conventional programming learning approach in terms of students’ programming logic concepts, problem-solving awareness, technology acceptance, and satisfaction with the learning approach. Accordingly, discussion and suggestions are provided for future research.}

abstract = {This special issue raises two thematic questions: (1) How will AI change learning in the future and what role will human beings play in the interaction with machine learning, and (2), What can we learn from the articles in this special issue for future research? These questions are reflected in the frame of the recent discussion of human and machine learning. AI for learning provides many applications and multimodal channels for supporting people in cognitive and non-cognitive task domains. The articles in this special issue evidence that agency, engagement, self-efficacy, and collaboration are needed in learning and working with intelligent tools and environments. The importance of social elements is also clear in the articles. The articles also point out that the teacher’s role in digital pedagogy primarily involves facilitating and coaching. AI in learning has a high potential, but it also has many limitations. Many worries are linked with ethical issues, such as biases in algorithms, privacy, transparency, and data ownership. This special issue also highlights the concepts of explainability and explicability in the context of human learning. We need much more research and research-based discussion for making AI more trustworthy for users in learning environments and to prevent misconceptions.}

abstract = {Whole number computations are a critical skill that serves as a foundation upon which higher-order concepts in mathematics are taught to children. To facilitate their instruction, educators often use multiple representations to support a child’s cognition. Representations with physical manipulatives are widely studied through a graduated instructional sequence featuring concrete, representational, and abstract stages of learning. In contrast, research on representational sequences featuring virtual manipulatives is less robust. Thus, this study evaluated an instructional strategy with virtual manipulatives, static representational drawings, and abstract algorithms to teach multiplication to three U.S. elementary students with mathematics difficulty. A functional relation was established via a single-subject multiple probe design between the treatment and students’ accuracy performance. Baseline-corrected Tau estimates confirmed a medium effect size for all three students, while student performance on measures assessing the number of errors committed and the duration of sessions also returned favorable findings.}

abstract = {Computational methods have increased the objectivity of measures of human behavior and positioned personality science to benefit from the ongoing digital revolution. In this review, we define and discuss computational personality assessment (CPA), a measurement process that uses computational technologies to obtain estimates of personality. We briefly review some of the most promising sources of data currently used for CPA: mobile sensing, digital footprints from social media, images, language, and experience sampling. We present a concise overview of key findings, discuss the promise and opportunities of CPA (e.g., moving towards objective measures of personality, obtaining new insights from big data), and highlight important limitations and challenges in the development and application of CPA (e.g., establishing reliability and validity, selecting appropriate ground truth criterion, assessing affect and cognition, implications for ethics and privacy). We conclude with our perspective on how CPA could change our understanding of individual differences.}

abstract = {This article presents the design, construct validation, and reliability of a self-report instrument in Spanish that aims to characterize different types of strategies that students can use to learn computer programming. We provide a comprehensive overview of the identification of learning strategies in the existing literature, the design and development of preliminary questionnaire items, the refinement of item wording, and the examination of the internal structure and reliability of the final instrument. The construction of the items was based on the educational theory of Self-Regulated Learning. The final version of the questionnaire, called the Computer Programming Learning Strategies Questionnaire (CEAPC), was administered to 647 students enrolled in computer programming courses. The data collected from the participants were used to examine the construct validity and reliability of the questionnaire. The CEAPC consists of 13 subscales, each corresponding to a different type of learning strategy, and a total of 89 items. Statistical analyses of the data indicate that the CEAPC has adequate construct validity. In addition, the results of the internal consistency analysis indicate satisfactory reliability across the different subscales of the instrument. This study contributes to the field of educational research, particularly in the area of self-regulated learning in computer programming.}

abstract = {In higher education, it is challenging to cultivate non-computer science majors’ programming concepts. This study used the GAME model (gamification, assessment, modeling, and enquiry) in a programming education course to enhance undergraduates’ self-efficacy and performance of basic programming concepts. There were 83 undergraduates taking part in this study, which adopted a quasi-experimental research design. Students in the experimental group (n = 43) experienced a course in which the GAME model was used to design the block-based programming course. The control group (n = 40) was given a general information education course covering similar learning concepts without the game-based learning strategy. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was adopted to investigate the effect of the GAME model on students’ learning outcomes for the quantitative data. In the qualitative analysis, students’ responses to the course perception questionnaire were coded and analyzed. The results showed that students in the experimental group outperformed their counterparts regarding self-efficacy and basic programming concepts. The experimental treatment resulted in a small to medium effect size difference between the two groups. The results showed that incorporating the GAME model into block-based programming teaching helped improve undergraduates’ self-efficacy and performance of basic programming concepts. In addition, these experimental group undergraduates also perceived the pedagogic GAME model positively. Several research suggestions are proposed based on the findings of the present study.}

abstract = {Uzbekistan has not adopted robotics education as the school curriculum yet. However, several robotics learning centers have introduced robotics education in an informal setting. This research paper aims to highlight the essence of robotics education in Uzbekistan investigating the perception of parents and children to their full potential and identifying impediments to the process of implementing robotics in Uzbekistan. This research study involves primary and secondary research methods. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine the reflection of robotics education among primary and secondary school children. Official statistical data was gathered to prove the scope of demographics. Primary data was collected through the survey among parents whose children attended robotics classes. Ultimately, the authors have used empirical evidence to provide recommendations and solutions on how to implement robotics education effectively in Uzbekistan. Much emphasis has not been put on robotics education in Uzbekistan, despite reforms in the field of STEM education. Moreover, the condition (including teachers, lesson materials, classrooms, computers, and robotics kits) to implement robotics classes as more developed countries are doing has not been created properly, which hampers the introduction of robotics at schools. In addition, the majority of parents are not fully aware of the authentic value of robotics education in children’s lives. Hence, Uzbek schools are lagging in the field of robotics.}
