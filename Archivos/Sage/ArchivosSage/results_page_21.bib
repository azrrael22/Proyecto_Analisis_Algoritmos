abstract = {The prevalent availability of high-performance computing coupled with validated computerized simulation platforms as open-source packages have motivated progress in the development of realistic anthropomorphic computational models of the human anatomy. The main application of these advanced tools focused on imaging physics and computational internal/external radiation dosimetry research. This paper provides an updated review of state-of-the-art developments and recent advances in the design of sophisticated computational models of the human anatomy with a particular focus on their use in radiation dosimetry calculations. The consolidation of flexible and realistic computational models with biological data and accurate radiation transport modeling tools enables the capability to produce dosimetric data reflecting actual setup in clinical setting. These simulation methodologies and results are helpful resources for the medical physics and medical imaging communities and are expected to impact the fields of medical imaging and dosimetry calculations profoundly.}

abstract = {In this dialogue, Phillip Howard introduces “computational propaganda” as an emerging communication tool in political communication and a perspective for investigating misinformation and disinformation. By articulating the concepts, patterns, and mechanisms of computational propaganda, Howard proposes a socio-technical framework for studying computational propaganda. He calls for mixed methods to undertake computational research alongside qualitative investigation, thus addressing the computational as well as the political. Howard emphasizes the battle against algorithm bias, manipulation, and misinformation, and he advocates building an International Panel on the Information Environment (IPIE), an international scientific collaboration, to respond to the challenges. In addition, Howard offers advice on further research in computational propaganda.}

abstract = {This intervention advances glitches as epistemological vectors for apprehending and engaging the significance of digitally-mediated spatialities that appear nonperformative against normative scripts of urban computational paradigms. Drawing on two strands of contemporary thinking about glitches as systemic design features of digital systems and as generative fissures within them, we mobilize a queer orientation that stays with the generative tensions of urban spatialities that present as idiosyncratic and as interrupting. We mobilize this epistemological approach through illustrative U.S. based examples of seemingly abandoned shared e-bikes, performatively ‘ugly’ homes, and wilful property dilapidation wrought through the registers of desire and aesthetics. In so doing, we show how glitch empistemologies render visible how the technocapitalist manufacturing of normative spatial desires for particular kinds of urban sociospatialities and aesthetic visual signatures are both secured and interrupted on digitally-mediated and -mediatized terrains. Glitch epistemologies establish the significance of small-scale disorientations in digital urban mediations, engaging these nonperformativities and non-computes as unexceptional openings onto everyday possibilities for politics in computational cities.}

abstract = {This paper documents a computational approach to the design, fabrication, and assembly of customizable space structures built entirely out of flat-cut interlocking elements without the need of nodes, fasteners, cement, or glue. Following a Research by Design (RbD) methodology, we establish a framework comprising geometric and parametric modeling, structural analysis, and digital fabrication stages to examine the following research question: how might the modularity of a construction kit be combined with the plasticity of parametric descriptions to facilitate the design and fabrication of flat-cut space structures? We find that an adaptive joint design that resolves local deformations at the node and element levels can facilitate the construction of flat-cut space structures by making modular components responsive to local geometric, material, and mechanical demands. The research centers on the design and construction of an architecture-scale installation based on the Weaire-Phelan structure—an aperiodic space-filling geometric structure that approximates the geometry of foam—entirely out of flat-cut interlocking elements. Documenting the process in technical detail, as well as some limitations, the paper contributes to recent efforts to develop digital materials suitable for architectural applications. In addition, it contributes to extend the formal and architectural possibilities of flat-cut space structure design by facilitating “bottom-up” design explorations in concert with the structure’s tectonic resolution.}

abstract = {Idea generation in the design production process often occurs within brainstorming sessions. Linking ideas is the key mechanism in the process of producing design. Through linking ideas, a graph-like knowledge is achieved in representing the individual memories, with the nodes and arcs being the ideas and the links between ideas respectively. The design process is similar to doing a jigsaw. Using the jigsaw metaphor, a cognitive study is applied to the design tool DIM (Dynamic Idea Map) to explore computational jigsaw mechanisms. Thereafter, a computational framework called Design Jigsaw is developed to support students in assembling vast ideas effectively and reveals the construction of meaning in the graph-like knowledge structure of design thinking}

abstract = {Mapping a public discourse with the tools of computational text analysis comes with many contingencies in the areas of corpus curation, data processing and analysis, and visualisation. However, the complexity of algorithmic assemblies and the beauty of resulting images give the impression of ‘objectivity’. Instead of concealing uncertainties and artefacts in order to tell a coherent and all-encompassing story, retaining the variety of alternative assemblies may actually strengthen the method. By utilising the mobility of digital devices, we could create mutable mobiles that allow access to our laboratories and enable challenging rearrangements and interpretations.}

abstract = {Algorithmic media have adopted and adapted divinatory practices and vernaculars of prediction, prophecy, probability, fortune-telling and forecasting – suggesting a possible link between artificial intelligence and pre-scientific modes of speculation. Statistical thinking and magical thinking, too, can be recognised as closely correlated epistemological systems for governing societies and ways of life. In fact, primitive astrological practices of looking up at the stars may represent one of the earliest statistical projects involving sophisticated calculations and data sets. Such pattern-making techniques could even be considered precursory to machine learning. As a point of departure for exploring these eclectic relationships between stars and data, magic and machines, I use a media archaeological methodology to question the historical roles of both astrological and computational divination in mediating methods of control, surveillance and knowledge production across transforming societal contexts. This methodology is especially relevant for examining historical narratives in the field of cultural studies as it makes apparent the hyper-connectedness between objects, cultural representation and sites of hegemonic contention. My findings reveal relationships between celestial pattern recognition and efforts to exert control over and manipulate the natural environment and its populations, the historical impact of meteorological and climatological practices for predicting and influencing future events with artificial intelligence, and links between statistics and algorithmic data biases. This article suggests a speculative genealogy of astrology and artificial intelligence, as well as a genealogy of the theological, scientific and machinic unconscious.}

abstract = {Since the publication in 1948 of Norbert Wiener’s Cybernetics, this thought model has exerted a profound influence in contemporary knowledge. Such influence has been decisive for a paradigm shift in the profession of architecture and particularly for the rise of a computational perspective in architectural design. This article explores the link between the cybernetic paradigm and the conception of architectural objects as performative, responsive, intelligent, and sentient artifacts—the visions of buildings that have been central to the development of digital architecture since its early stages. This connection shows that the dominant visions of design problems associated with the development of a computational perspective in architecture have not been exclusively the result of the introduction of computer pragmatics in architectural design. On the contrary, following such scholars as Bruno Latour and Katherine Hayles, these developments must be considered as the result of a particular feedback process that includes technical aspects as well as the definition of design problems around an informational ontology and epistemology. The understanding of the intellectual foundations of digital architecture is crucial not only to promote a critical regard of its productions but to imagine scenarios for a viable cybernetic practice of computer-mediated architectural design.}

abstract = {In this study I examine the use of visualization within everyday research practices in computational physics. In doing so, I attempt to move from the well documented representational issues elicited by the concept of the image, to more microscale issues of the habitual structuring of the everyday that emerge when a specific example of science in the making is analysed. To this end, I focus on one specific example, of tracing a computational error through a fluid dynamics simulation of the ‘lock exchange’ experiment. This simulation is one small part of the research that goes on within one of Europe’s largest computational physics research groups, the Applied Modelling and Computation Group at Imperial College in London, where I am involved in ongoing ethnographic fieldwork research. Visualization is shown to play a central role, not just in daily routines of investigation and problem solving, but in the process of habituation through which scientists cultivate the dispositions through which everyday life gains its texture and form. Far from being a detachable representation of a part of a world, simulation is shown to come into being as a process within a world structured by the repetitions and improvizations that characterize research practice.}
