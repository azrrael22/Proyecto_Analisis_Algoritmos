abstract = {Cement augmentation in vertebrae (vertebroplasty) is usually used to restore mechanical strength after spinal fracture but could also be used as a prophylactic treatment. So far, the mechanical competence has been determined immediately post-treatment, without considering long-term effects of bone adaptation. In this work, we investigated such long-term effects of vertebroplasty on the stiffness of the augmented bone by means of computational simulation of bone adaptation. Using micro-finite element analysis, we determined sites of increased mechanical stress (stress raisers) and stress shielding and, based on the simulations, regions with increased or decreased bone loss due to augmentation. Cement volumes connecting the end plates led to increased stress shielding and bone loss. The increased stiffness due to the augmentation, however, remained constant over the simulation time of 30 years. If the intervention was performed at an earlier time point, it did lead to more bone loss, but again, it did not affect long-term stability as this loss was compensated by bone gains in other areas. In particular, around the augmentation cement, bone structures were preserved, suggesting a long-term integration of the cement in the augmented bone. We conclude that, from a biomechanical perspective, the impact of vertebroplasty on the bone at the microstructural level is less detrimental than previously thought.}

abstract = {Image-based computational modeling is becoming an increasingly used clinical tool to provide insight into the mechanisms of reentrant arrhythmias. In the context of ischemic heart disease, faithful representation of the electrophysiological properties of the infarct region within models is essential, due to the scars known for arrhythmic properties. Here, we review the different computational representations of the infarcted region, summarizing the experimental measurements upon which they are based. We then focus on the two most common representations of the scar core (complete insulator or electrically passive tissue) and perform simulations of electrical propagation around idealized infarct geometries. Our simulations highlight significant differences in action potential duration and focal effective refractory period (ERP) around the scar, driven by differences in electrotonic loading, depending on the choice of scar representation. Finally, a novel mechanism for arrhythmia induction, following a focal ectopic beat, is demonstrated, which relies on localized gradients in ERP directly caused by the electrotonic sink effects of the neighboring passive scar.}

abstract = {Abstract This paper describes a study of the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to investigate the performance of a precalciner vessel at a cement works, In this vessel, limestone, held in suspension, is calcined to calcium oxide and the endothermic reaction is supported by the combustion of coal. Results are presented from a CFD model that contains all the essential features of the precalciner as operated when burning coal. The model fully represents the reactions and fluid dynamics of the precalciner. Previously unidentified features are illustrated. Certain key features at points in the precalciner, where some limited measurements can be made, are compared with the parameters indicated by the computational model. The measurements are consistent with the results calculated by the model indicating fair validation. The CFD data show the following 1 The gases undergo distinct recirculation. 2 The coal particles entering at one inlet have significantly different trajectories and temperature histories from those entering at the second diametrically opposed inlet. 3 There is 90 per cent completion of coal combustion at the exit. 4 73 per cent limestone in the raw meal is calcined to calcined to calcium oxide at the exit from the precalciner. 5 The highest reaction rate of the raw meal is closer to one side of the vessel due to interaction with the gas flows. Future work is proposed which, firstly, will provide further validation of the results so far attained by selective measurements on the precalciner and, secondly, will model the combustion and aerodynamic behaviour of waste-derived fuels in the precalciner vessel, commencing with shredded car tyre chips.}

abstract = {Advanced non-linear dynamics, finite element computational methods and tools are utilized in order to assess the blast wave mitigation potential of the fluid–structure interaction phenomena involving rigid and deformable structures. The employed computational methods and tools are verified and validated by first demonstrating that they can quite accurately reproduce analytical solutions for a couple of well-defined blast wave propagation and interaction problems. Then the methods/tools are used to investigate the fluid–structure interaction phenomena involving deformable structures while accounting for both the interaction of the incident blast wave with the structure and for the structure-motion induced blast wave (at the back-face of the structure). To assess the role of the structure deformability, i.e. the role of the shock waves generated within the structure, the results obtained are compared with their rigid structure counterparts. This comparison established that no additional structure-deformability-related blast-mitigation effects are observed in the case of fully supported blast wave loading while, under exponentially decaying blast wave loading, such effects are observed but only under conditions when the shock wave propagation time within the structure is comparable with the incident wave decay time.}

abstract = {Objectives: Competent velopharyngeal (VP) function is the basis for normal speech. Understanding how VP structure influences the airflow during speech details is essential to the surgical improvement of pharyngoplasty. In this study, we aimed to illuminate the airflow features corresponding to various VP closure states using computed dynamic simulations. Methods: Three-dimensional models of the upper airways were established based on computed tomography of 8 volunteers. The velopharyngeal port was simulated by a cylinder. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were applied to illustrate the correlation between the VP port size and the airflow parameters, including the flow velocity, pressure in the velopharyngeal port, as well as the pressure in oral and nasal cavity. Results: The airflow dynamics at the velopharynx were maintained in the same velopharyngeal pattern as the area of the velopharyngeal port increased from 0 to 25 mm2. A total of 5 airflow patterns with distinct features were captured, corresponding to adequate closure, adequate/borderline closure (Class I and II), borderline/inadequate closure, and inadequate closure. The maximal orifice area that could be tolerated for adequate VP closure was determined to be 2.01 mm2. Conclusion: Different VP functions are of characteristic airflow dynamic features. Computational fluid dynamic simulation is of application potential in individualized VP surgery planning.}

abstract = {In recent years it has become clear that carcinogenesis is a complex process, both at the molecular and cellular levels. Understanding the origins, growth and spread of cancer, therefore requires an integrated or system-wide approach. Computational systems biology is an emerging sub-discipline in systems biology that utilizes the wealth of data from genomic, proteomic and metabolomic studies to build computer simulations of intra and intercellular processes. Several useful descriptive and predictive models of the origin, growth and spread of cancers have been developed in an effort to better understand the disease and potential therapeutic approaches. In this review we describe and assess the practical and theoretical underpinnings of commonly-used modeling approaches, including ordinary and partial differential equations, petri nets, cellular automata, agent based models and hybrid systems. A number of computer-based formalisms have been implemented to improve the accessibility of the various approaches to researchers whose primary interest lies outside of model development. We discuss several of these and describe how they have led to novel insights into tumor genesis, growth, apoptosis, vascularization and therapy.}

abstract = {Building energy simulations coupled with computational fluid dynamics tools have emerged, recently, as an accurate and effective tool to improve the estimation of energy requirements and thermal comfort in buildings. Building modelers and researchers usually implement this coupling in the boundary conditions of both tools (e.g. surface temperature, ambient temperature, and conductive and convective fluxes). This work reviews how the building energy simulation–computational fluid dynamics coupling has evolved since its first implementation to the present day. Moreover, this article also summarizes and discusses the research studies in which the building energy simulation–computational fluid dynamics coupling has been used to analyze building systems, building components, and building urban configurations. Implementing a building energy simulation–computational fluid dynamics coupling brings a series of benefits when compared with the conventional building energy simulation methodology, a building energy simulation–computational fluid dynamics coupling provides an improvement that ranges between 10% and 50% for estimating the building energy requirements. Moreover, the computation time to implement computational fluid dynamics with information obtained from the building energy simulation could be reduced by as well.}

abstract = {In informal argument, an essential step is to ask what will “resonate” with a particular audience and hence persuade. Marketers, for example, may recommend a certain colour for a new soda can because it “pops” on Instagram; politicians may “fine-tune” diction for different social demographics. This paper engages the need to strategise for such resonance by offering a method for automating opposition analysis (OA), a technique from semiotics used in marketing and literary analysis to plot objects of interest on oppositional axes. Central to our computational approach is a reframing of texts as proxies for thought and opposition as the product of oscillation in thought in response to those proxies, a model to which the contextual similarity information contained in word embeddings is relevant. We illustrate our approach with an analysis of texts on gun control from ProCon.org, implementing a three-step method to: 1) identify relatively prominent signifiers; 2) rank possible opposition pairs on prominence and contextual similarity scores; and 3) derive plot values for proxies on opposition pair axes. The results are discussed in terms of strategies for informal argument that might be derived by those on each side of gun control.}
