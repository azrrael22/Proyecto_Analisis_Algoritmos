abstract = {The simulation of cardiac electrophysiology is a mature field in computational physiology. Recent advances in medical imaging, high-performance computing and numerical methods mean that computational models of electrical propagation in human heart tissue are ripe for use in patient-specific simulation for diagnosis, for prognosis and for selection of treatment methods. However, in order to move in this direction, it is necessary to make efficient use of modern petascale computing resources. This paper focuses on an existing open source simulation framework (Chaste) and documents work done to improve the parallel scaling on a small range of electrophysiology benchmark problems. These benchmarks involve the numerical solution of the monodomain or bidomain equations via the finite-element method. At the beginning of this study the electrophysiology libraries within Chaste were already enabled to run in parallel and were able to solve for electrical propagation using the monodomain or bidomain equations, but parallel efficiency dropped rapidly when run on more than about 64 processors. Throughout the course of the study, improvements were made to problem definition input; geometric mesh partitioning; finite-element assembly of large, sparse linear systems; problem-specific matrix preconditioning; numerical solution of the linear system; and output of the approximate solution. The consequence of these improvements is that, at the end of the study, Chaste is able to solve a monodomain benchmark problem in close to real time. While some of the improvements made to the parallel Chaste code are specific to cardiac electrophysiology, many of the techniques documented in this paper are generic to the parallel finite-element method in other scientific application areas.}

abstract = {Background Septal deviation is an extremely common anatomic variation in healthy adults. However, there are no standard criteria to determine when a deviated septum is clinically relevant. Presently, selection of patients for septoplasty is based on mostly clinical examination, which is prone to observer bias and may lead to unsuccessful treatment. The objective of this article is twofold. First, we investigate whether the location of a septal deviation within the nasal passages affects nasal resistance. Second, we test whether computer simulations are consistent with rhinomanometry studies in predicting that anterior septal deviations increase nasal resistance more than posterior deviations. Methods A three-dimensional computational model of a healthy nose was created from computed tomography scans. Geometry-deforming software was used to produce models with septal deviations. Computational fluid dynamics techniques were used to simulate nasal airflow and compute nasal resistance. Results Our results revealed that the posterior nasal cavity can accommodate significant septal deviations without a substantial increase in airway resistance. In contrast, a deviation in the nasal valve region more than doubled nasal resistance. These findings are in good agreement with the rhinomanometry literature and with the observation that patients with anterior septal deviations benefit the most from septoplasty. Conclusions In the model, anterior septal deviations increased nasal resistance more than posterior deviations. This suggests, in agreement with the literature, that other causes of nasal obstruction (dysfunction of the nasal valve, allergy, etc.) should be carefully considered in patients with posterior septal deviations because such deviations may not affect nasal resistance. This study illustrates how computational modeling and virtual manipulation of the nasal geometry are useful to investigate nasal physiology.}

abstract = {Objective Healthcare systems require transformation to meet societal challenges and projected health demands. Digital and computational tools and approaches are fundamental to this transformation, and hospitals have a key role to play in their development and implementation. This paper reports on a study with the objective of exploring the challenges encountered by hospital leaders and innovators as they implement a strategy to become a data-driven hospital organisation. In doing so, this paper provides guidance to future leaders and innovators seeking to build computational and digital capabilities in complex clinical settings. Methods Interviews were undertaken with 42 participants associated with a large public hospital organisation within England’s National Health Service. Using the concept of institutional readiness as an analytical framework, the paper explores participants’ perspectives on the organisation’s capacity to support the development of, and benefit from, digital and computational approaches. Results Participants’ accounts reveal a range of specific institutional readiness criteria relating to organisational vision, technical capability, organisational agility, and talent and skills that, when met, enhance the organisations’ capacity to support the development and implementation of digital and computational tools. Participant accounts also reveal challenges relating to these criteria, such as unrealistic expectations and the necessary prioritisation of clinical work in resource-constrained settings. Conclusions The paper identifies a general set of institutional readiness criteria that can guide future hospital leaders and innovators aiming to improve their organisation’s digital and computational capability. The paper also illustrates the challenges of pursuing digital and computational innovation in resource-constrained hospital environments.}

abstract = {Determining and understanding the performance characteristics of marine propellers by experiments is quite a complex and costly task. Numerical predictions using computational fluid dynamics simulations could be a valuable alternative provided that the laminar-to-turbulent transition flow effects are fundamentally understood with the suitable numerical models developed. Experience suggests that the use of classical turbulent flow models may lead to high discrepancies especially at low rotational speeds where the effects of fluid flow transition from the laminar to the turbulent state may influence the predicted propeller’s performance. This article proposes a complete and detailed procedure for the computational fluid dynamics simulation of non-cavitating flow over marine propellers using the “k–kl–ω” transition-sensitive turbulence model. Results are evaluated by “ANSYS FLUENT 16” for the “INSEAN E779A” propeller. Comparisons against the fully turbulent standard “k–ε” model and against experiments show improved agreement in way of flow transition zones at lower rotational speeds, that is, at low Reynolds numbers.}

abstract = {This paper describes the use of computational fluid dynamics in teaching graduate students who were in a four‐year B. Tech program. Many of these students did not have a good background in mathematics, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and programming; however, most of them were good at computer‐aided design in ProE and were very interested in learning computational fluid dynamics as a design tool in industries. Solidworks flow simulator was chosen as the computational fluid dynamics software to teach students the entire computational fluid dynamics process in a single integrated software environment. Based on projects, computational fluid dynamics numerical methods and fundamentals of heat transfer and fluid flow were introduced to help students understand the computational fluid dynamics process, interpret, and validate simulation results. The computational fluid dynamics simulation of an orifice meter is given as the basic example for the students. Orifice meters are the most common equipment used for measuring fluid flow because of their simple mechanical structure, versatility, and low cost. In this paper, computational fluid dynamics simulation has been used to predict the orifice flow with better accuracy. Computational fluid dynamics simulations have been performed using solidworks flow simulator and validated with the data available in published literature. A new system has been proposed to accurately measure the flow using orifice metering systems.}

abstract = {Past research has shown that multidimensional computational fluid dynamics modeling in combination with a genetic algorithm method is an effective approach for optimizing internal combustion engine design. However, optimization studies performed with a detailed computational fluid dynamics model are time intensive, which limits the practical application of this approach. This study addresses this issue by using a machine learning approach called Gaussian process regression in combination with computational fluid dynamics modeling to reduce the computational optimization time. An approach was proposed where the Gaussian process regression model could be used instead of the computational fluid dynamics model to predict the outputs of the genetic algorithm optimization. In this approach, for every nth generation of the genetic algorithm, the data from the previous n − 1 generations was used to train the Gaussian process regression model. The approach was tested on an engine optimization study with five input parameters. When the genetic algorithm was run solely with computational fluid dynamics, the optimization took 50 days to complete. In comparison with the computational fluid dynamics and Gaussian process regression approach, the computational time was reduced by 62%, and the optimization was completed in 19 days using the same amount of computational resources. Additional parametric studies were performed to investigate the impact of genetic algorithm + Gaussian process regression parameters. Results showed that either reducing the initial dataset size or relaxing the error criterion resulted in increased Gaussian process regression evaluations within the genetic algorithm. However, relaxing the error criterion was found to impact the model predictions negatively. The initial dataset size was found to have a negligible impact on the final optimum design. Finally, the potential of machine learning in further improving the optimization process was explored by using the Gaussian process regression model to check for the robustness of the designs to operating parameter variations during the optimization. The genetic algorithm was repeated with the modified procedure and it was shown that adding the stability check resulted in a different, more reliable and stable optimum solution.}

abstract = {The effects of hydrogen addition to internal combustion engines operated by natural gas/methane has been widely demonstrated experimentally in the literature. Already small hydrogen contents in the fuel show promising benefits with respect to increased engine efficiency, lower CO2 emissions, extended lean operating limits and a higher exhaust gas recirculation tolerance while maintaining the knock resistance of methane. In this article, the influence of hydrogen addition to methane on a spark ignited single cylinder engine is investigated. This article proposes a modelling approach to consider hydrogen addition within three-dimensional reactive computational fluid dynamics in order to establish a framework to gain further insights into the involved processes. Experiments have been performed on a single-cylinder spark-ignition engine situated at a test bed and cater as reference data for validating the proposed reactive computational fluid dynamics modelling approach based around the G-Equation combustion model. Within the course of the first part, crucial aspects relevant to the modelling of the mean engine cycle are highlighted. In this article, a simplified early combustion phase model which considers the transition towards a fully developed turbulent flame following ignition is introduced, along with a second submodel considering combined effects of the walls. The sensitivity of the combustion process towards the modelling approach is presented. The submodels were calibrated for a reference operating point, and a sweep in hydrogen content in the fuel as well as stoichiometric and lean operation has been considered. It is shown that the flame speed coefficient A appearing in the used turbulent flame speed closure, weighting the influence of the turbulent fluctuating speed , has to be adjusted for different hydrogen contents. The introduced submodels allowed for significant improvement of the in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate evolution throughout all considered operating conditions.}

The rotor performance was analyzed over specific domains of the parameters under study, and three-variable Box-Behnken design was used for design of experiment. The specific parametric combinations as per design of experiment were simulated using ANSYS Fluent®, and the response variable, coefficient of performance (Cp), was calculated. The sliding mesh model was utilized, and the flow was simulated using Shear Stress Transport (SST) k − ω model. The model was validated using past experimental results and found to predict parametric effects accurately.

abstract = {Background Nasal adhesions (NAs) are a known complication of nasal airway surgery. Even minor NAs can lead to significant postoperative nasal airway obstruction (NAO). Division of such NAs often provides much greater relief than anticipated. Objective We examine the impact of NAs at various anatomical sites on nasal airflow and mucosal cooling using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and multiple test subjects. Methods CT scans of healthy adult subjects were used to construct three-dimensional nasal airway computational models. A single virtual 2.5 mm diameter NA was placed at one of five sites commonly seen following NAO surgery within each nasal cavity bilaterally, resulting in 10 NA models and 1 NA-free control for each subject. CFD analysis was performed on each NA model and compared with the subject’s NA-free control model. Results 4 subjects were recruited to create 44 computational models. The NAs caused the airflow streamlines to separate, leading to a statistically significant increase in mucosal temperature immediately downstream to the NAs (wake region). Changes in the mucosal temperature in the wake region of the NAs were most prominent in anteriorly located NAs with a mean increase of 1.62 °C for the anterior inferior turbinate NAs (P < .001) and 0.63 °C for the internal valve NAs (P < .001). Conclusion NAs result in marked disruption to airflow patterns and reduced mucosal cooling on critical surfaces, particularly in the wake region. Reduced wake region mucosal cooling may be a contributing factor to the exaggerated perception of nasal obstruction experienced by patients with NAs.}
