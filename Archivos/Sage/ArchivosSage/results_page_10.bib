abstract = {Background Recent years have seen the resurgence of board games designed for entertainment, and to teach or explicate real life problems. The revival of board gameplay has been discussed in mainstream media, and has drawn the attention of researchers. Yet, in the field of games studies, the conception of games as learning spaces is mostly emphasized through digital/video games. Aim This literature review reveals the current knowledge regarding the learning potential of board games in various settings, subjects, and diverse learners. Results Board games are spaces for mathematical learning and learning spaces that can enable the learning of various contents. Board games allow for various interactions that result in players engaging in computational thinking, teamwork, and creativity. Conclusion The relationship between board gameplay and learning is evidenced across disciplines and countries. Board games simplify complex issues and systems, which make them appropriate to further explore learning and concepts such as motivation and computational thinking in formal and informal settings. Furthermore, there is need to expand research on learning in commercial board games.}

abstract = {Computational thinking has been gaining new impetus in the academic community and in K-12 level education. Scratch is a visual programming environment that can be utilized to teach and learn introductory computing concepts. There are some studies investigating the effectiveness of Scratch for K-12 level education. However, studies that have been conducted at the collegiate level, especially in the context of preservice computing teacher education, are very rare. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of Scratch-based instruction on preservice teachers’ understanding of basic programming concepts and their attitudes toward programming. In the present study, a mixed method design was utilized. In the first phase of the study, the data were collected using an achievement test, a practice test, and a computer programming attitude scale. In the second phase of the study, data were collected through a semistructured interview. The results of the study indicated that preservice teachers in Scratch-based instruction had significantly better understanding of basic computing concepts. Qualitative data indicated that Scratch-based instruction was useful in constructing a more meaningful learning environment for preservice teachers. The results of this study have implications for researchers and preservice computing teacher educators when designing an introductory computing course.}

abstract = {Pattern recognition is an important skill in computational thinking. In this study, an equation puzzle game was developed by combining pattern recognition with algebraic reasoning, and scaffolding was designed to support learners’ learning. Sixty participants were enrolled in this study, divided into a control group and an experimental group to compare the results and differences in game achievement, flow, anxiety, and motivation of participants with and without algebraic reasoning scaffolding. The results of the study showed that the participants in both groups had positive flow and motivation during the game, did not feel over-anxious, and there was no significant difference in the game achievement of the two groups. In addition, the game with the scaffolding may have the potential to make a positive correlation between game achievement and psychological status. The results of this study indicated that the game did not cause too much anxiety to the participants. The scaffolding-based design achieves the intended effect on the participants’ assistance and facilitates the participants’ engagement in pattern recognition problem solving. And as learners became more focused and engaged, they could also perform better in the game. This game mechanism can be used as a reference for designing pattern recognition games.}

abstract = {Although participatory culture promotes productive engagement in online spaces, members may respond in ways that constrain digital composition practices. This article provides theoretical and contextual background regarding a shift toward digital media production and programming-as-writing for youth. In addition, I describe the intersecting of computational thinking, computational participation, and participatory culture within Scratch, an online programming community. Findings from a descriptive case study focused on early adolescents as they engaged in digital media composition within an online programming community called Scratch are examined. Specifically, I discuss the contrast in the digital composition experiences of two participants as they leveraged participatory culture in the creation of digital media. This research highlights assumptions made regarding participatory cultures and the need to consider how to foster productive and sustainable digital literacy practices for youth in participatory cultures.}

abstract = {The integration of visual programming in early formal education has been found to promote computational thinking of students. Teachers’ intuitive perspectives about optimal learning processes – “folk psychology” – impact their perspectives about teaching “folk pedagogy” and play a significant role in integrating educational technologies, such as visual programming, within the formal curriculum. This study was conducted based on the mixed method research paradigm. First, a folk pedagogy questionnaire was distributed to 89 teachers who integrate differing technologies in their classroom in order to identify the teachers’ pedagogical perspectives: constructivist versus instructivist. Then, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 teachers who teach Scratch in order to gain a deeper understanding of their instructivist/constructivist perspectives and actual pedagogical practices and strategies. Finally, we analyzed 96 students’ programming artifacts to explore differences, if any, in students’ outcomes related to the pedagogical perspectives of their teachers. Findings revealed that pedagogical perspectives are reflected in teaching strategies and assessment practices employed in a visual programming environment. It is promising that teaching visual programming promoted constructivist pedagogy even among instructivist teachers and was consequently reflected in student perspectives and expressed in their programming artifacts. We discuss theoretical and educational implications of these findings.}

abstract = {This syndicate offers four recommendations to help educators adjust curricula to accommodate the rapid integration of data into journalism. First, instruction in numeracy and basic descriptive statistics must be required as either modules in existing courses or as separate offerings. Second, students should be taught to avoid mistakes in interpreting and writing about data in both reporting and visual classes. Third, ethics courses should discuss data as a transparency tool that poses distinctive dilemmas. Fourth, computational thinking, or how to dissect and solve problems like a computer does, can be incorporated into existing classes that teach logic.}

abstract = {While pedagogical and technological affordances of three-dimensional (3D) multiuser virtual worlds in various educational disciplines are largely well-known, a study about their effect on high school students’ engagement in introductory programming courses is still lacking. This case study presents students’ opinions about their participation in a 3D multiuser game-like environment, by harnessing Second Life in combination with the two-dimensional (2D) programming environment of Scratch4SL. Following a blended instructional format (face-to-face in a computer laboratory and supplementary online courses), 56 students utilizing Scratch4SL participated in this study, with a view to reduce the “steep learning curve” created during their first-time entrance into Second Life. This study identifies Papert’s theory of Constructionism as a potentially appropriate theoretical foundation for the development of an instructional framework, in order to assist students to coordinate and manage learning materials with other teammates, using their computational thinking skills in collaborative problem-based programming tasks. The study findings based on a mixed-method research (a close-ended questionnaire and an open-ended interview) indicated the effectiveness of this “constructionist-oriented” instructional process for students’ engagement to acquire or empower social, cognitive, higher-order, and computational thinking skills. Educational implications and recommendations for future research are also discussed.}

abstract = {Programming and computational thinking have emerged as compulsory skills in elementary school education. In 2018, Sweden has integrated programming in mathematics education with the rationale that it fosters problem solving and logical thinking skills and motivates students to learn mathematics. We investigated how teachers introduce programming in mathematics education in a Swedish primary school using an explorative case study. We followed four mathematics teachers during the first semester in which programming was mandatory. They taught second-, sixth- and ninth-grade students. Our contributions are threefold: we provide an account of how programming is taught in mathematics education; we discuss how teachers reflect on the challenge of teaching programming in mathematics; and we report on students’ understanding of programming and their view on the relationship between programming and mathematics.}

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has received much attention in mathematics education in recent years, and researchers have begun to experiment with the integration of CT into mathematics education to promote students’ CT and mathematical thinking (MT) development. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence and new theoretical perspectives on the mechanisms of interaction between CT and MT. To address this research gap, this study analyses the participants’ thinking processes in solving programming-based mathematical problems from a flexibility perspective, focusing on the interplay between computational and mathematical thinking, that is, how CT and MT work together to influence and determine the problem-solver’s choice of solution strategy. Using data collected from a large design-based study, we summarise two types of flexibility and six subtypes of flexibility demonstrated by participants in the programming-based mathematical problem-solving process using thematic analysis. These different types of flexibility provide researchers and mathematics educators with new theoretical perspectives to examine the interplay of CT and MT. Findings will also contribute toward student learning characteristics in programming-based mathematical problem-solving to sketch the big picture of how CT and MT emerge in complementary or mismatching ways.}
