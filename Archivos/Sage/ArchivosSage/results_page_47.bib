abstract = {This article discusses work on implementing emotional and cultural models into synthetic graphical characters. An architecture, FAtiMA, implemented first in the antibullying application FearNot! and then extended as FAtiMA-PSI in the cultural-sensitivity application ORIENT, is discussed. We discuss the modelling relationships between culture, social interaction, and cognitive appraisal. Integrating a lower level homeostatically based model is also considered as a means of handling some of the limitations of a purely symbolic approach. Evaluation to date is summarised and future directions discussed.}

abstract = {The prefix meta is popular in psychology as well as in other sciences oriented on the investigation of psychology. In the first case the usage is quite simple: every term is “the sum” of meta and usual psychological concept. In the second case, the situation is much more complicated. Sometimes, it is related to transition on a higher level of abstraction, from first-order to second-order investigations. Why is such a transition necessary and is it useful for scientific progress? The comparative analysis of the meta-approach to different sciences shows both specific peculiarities (reasons for application of the prefix, methods of manipulation and investigation, main objects of analysis, goals raised, and status of metaresearcher) and common features and regularities that may be discovered only in an interdisciplinary context. In this special section, we suggest a new way of application of meta-approach to psychology—in terms of metathinking. Our main idea is as follows: The wide circulation of meta-approach to psychology with necessity leads to serious changes in thinking of both researchers in the field of psychology and in sciences oriented on investigation of psychology.}

abstract = {Background Septal deviation is an extremely common anatomic variation in healthy adults. However, there are no standard criteria to determine when a deviated septum is clinically relevant. Presently, selection of patients for septoplasty is based on mostly clinical examination, which is prone to observer bias and may lead to unsuccessful treatment. The objective of this article is twofold. First, we investigate whether the location of a septal deviation within the nasal passages affects nasal resistance. Second, we test whether computer simulations are consistent with rhinomanometry studies in predicting that anterior septal deviations increase nasal resistance more than posterior deviations. Methods A three-dimensional computational model of a healthy nose was created from computed tomography scans. Geometry-deforming software was used to produce models with septal deviations. Computational fluid dynamics techniques were used to simulate nasal airflow and compute nasal resistance. Results Our results revealed that the posterior nasal cavity can accommodate significant septal deviations without a substantial increase in airway resistance. In contrast, a deviation in the nasal valve region more than doubled nasal resistance. These findings are in good agreement with the rhinomanometry literature and with the observation that patients with anterior septal deviations benefit the most from septoplasty. Conclusions In the model, anterior septal deviations increased nasal resistance more than posterior deviations. This suggests, in agreement with the literature, that other causes of nasal obstruction (dysfunction of the nasal valve, allergy, etc.) should be carefully considered in patients with posterior septal deviations because such deviations may not affect nasal resistance. This study illustrates how computational modeling and virtual manipulation of the nasal geometry are useful to investigate nasal physiology.}

abstract = {Objective Healthcare systems require transformation to meet societal challenges and projected health demands. Digital and computational tools and approaches are fundamental to this transformation, and hospitals have a key role to play in their development and implementation. This paper reports on a study with the objective of exploring the challenges encountered by hospital leaders and innovators as they implement a strategy to become a data-driven hospital organisation. In doing so, this paper provides guidance to future leaders and innovators seeking to build computational and digital capabilities in complex clinical settings. Methods Interviews were undertaken with 42 participants associated with a large public hospital organisation within England’s National Health Service. Using the concept of institutional readiness as an analytical framework, the paper explores participants’ perspectives on the organisation’s capacity to support the development of, and benefit from, digital and computational approaches. Results Participants’ accounts reveal a range of specific institutional readiness criteria relating to organisational vision, technical capability, organisational agility, and talent and skills that, when met, enhance the organisations’ capacity to support the development and implementation of digital and computational tools. Participant accounts also reveal challenges relating to these criteria, such as unrealistic expectations and the necessary prioritisation of clinical work in resource-constrained settings. Conclusions The paper identifies a general set of institutional readiness criteria that can guide future hospital leaders and innovators aiming to improve their organisation’s digital and computational capability. The paper also illustrates the challenges of pursuing digital and computational innovation in resource-constrained hospital environments.}

abstract = {Abstract The topics of verification and validation have increasingly been discussed in the field of computational biomechanics, and many recent articles have applied these concepts in an attempt to build credibility for models of complex biological systems. Verification and validation are evolving techniques that, if used improperly, can lead to false conclusions about a system under study. In basic science, these erroneous conclusions may lead to failure of a subsequent hypothesis, but they can have more profound effects if the model is designed to predict patient outcomes. While several authors have reviewed verification and validation as they pertain to traditional solid and fluid mechanics, it is the intent of this paper to present them in the context of computational biomechanics. Specifically, the task of model validation will be discussed, with a focus on current techniques. It is hoped that this review will encourage investigators to engage and adopt the verification and validation process in an effort to increase peer acceptance of computational biomechanics models.}

abstract = {Past research has shown that multidimensional computational fluid dynamics modeling in combination with a genetic algorithm method is an effective approach for optimizing internal combustion engine design. However, optimization studies performed with a detailed computational fluid dynamics model are time intensive, which limits the practical application of this approach. This study addresses this issue by using a machine learning approach called Gaussian process regression in combination with computational fluid dynamics modeling to reduce the computational optimization time. An approach was proposed where the Gaussian process regression model could be used instead of the computational fluid dynamics model to predict the outputs of the genetic algorithm optimization. In this approach, for every nth generation of the genetic algorithm, the data from the previous n − 1 generations was used to train the Gaussian process regression model. The approach was tested on an engine optimization study with five input parameters. When the genetic algorithm was run solely with computational fluid dynamics, the optimization took 50 days to complete. In comparison with the computational fluid dynamics and Gaussian process regression approach, the computational time was reduced by 62%, and the optimization was completed in 19 days using the same amount of computational resources. Additional parametric studies were performed to investigate the impact of genetic algorithm + Gaussian process regression parameters. Results showed that either reducing the initial dataset size or relaxing the error criterion resulted in increased Gaussian process regression evaluations within the genetic algorithm. However, relaxing the error criterion was found to impact the model predictions negatively. The initial dataset size was found to have a negligible impact on the final optimum design. Finally, the potential of machine learning in further improving the optimization process was explored by using the Gaussian process regression model to check for the robustness of the designs to operating parameter variations during the optimization. The genetic algorithm was repeated with the modified procedure and it was shown that adding the stability check resulted in a different, more reliable and stable optimum solution.}

Yet, no research has examined the extent to which information-processing, literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving skills in technologically rich environments may associate with having a STEM degree for various disability populations. This study analyzed the United States nationally representative data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) to examine associations between adult skills and having a STEM degree for people with and without disabilities. No direct associations were found between adult skills and having a STEM degree for people with learning disabilities or for people without disabilities. These groups’ information processing, literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving skills were not determining factors in STEM degree attainment. However, findings suggest a significant association between problem-solving skills and having a STEM degree for people with visual and/or hearing impairments. Policy implications are discussed.}

abstract = {Constructionism is at once a learning epistemology, a theory of learning, and a pedagogical approach that literally places education in the hands of learners. Constructionism situates students and mentors together in student-directed, project-oriented environments, often enabled with state-of-the-art computational technologies, to foster playful exploration and experimentation. Over time, shared learning experiences in constructionist environments may lead to the formation of learning cultures. To orient the design of constructionist environments for designers of engineering design education, this paper provides a historical context for Seymour Papert’s development of constructionism and distinguishes it from Jean Piaget’s philosophy of constructivism. Constructionism is introduced as an effort targeted at the reform of traditional education. Examples of constructionist environments for learning are then provided. The applicability of constructionism for the design of learning environments for engineering design is also discussed and observations are given for designing the tools, strategies, and activities that comprise constructionist learning environments for engineering design education.}

abstract = {We present results obtained with new instrumental methods for the acoustic analysis of prosody to evaluate prosody production by children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Typical Development (TD). Two tasks elicit focal stress — one in a vocal imitation paradigm, the other in a picture-description paradigm; a third task also uses a vocal imitation paradigm, and requires repeating stress patterns of two-syllable nonsense words. The instrumental methods differentiated significantly between the ASD and TD groups in all but the focal stress imitation task. The methods also showed smaller differences in the two vocal imitation tasks than in the picture-description task, as was predicted. In fact, in the nonsense word stress repetition task, the instrumental methods showed better performance for the ASD group. The methods also revealed that the acoustic features that predict auditory-perceptual judgment are not the same as those that differentiate between groups. Specifically, a key difference between the groups appears to be a difference in the balance between the various prosodic cues, such as pitch, amplitude, and duration, and not necessarily a difference in the strength or clarity with which prosodic contrasts are expressed.}
