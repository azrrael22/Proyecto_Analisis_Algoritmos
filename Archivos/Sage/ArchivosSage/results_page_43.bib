abstract = {TikTok has emerged as a powerful platform for the dissemination of mis- and disinformation about the war in Ukraine. During the initial three months after the Russian invasion in February 2022, videos under the hashtag #Ukraine garnered 36.9 billion views, with individual videos scaling up to 88 million views. Beyond the traditional methods of spreading misleading information through images and text, the medium of sound has emerged as a novel, platform-specific audiovisual technique. Our analysis distinguishes various war-related sounds utilized by both Ukraine and Russia and classifies them into a mis- and disinformation typology. We use computational propaganda features—automation, scalability, and anonymity—to explore how TikTok’s auditory practices are exploited to exacerbate information disorders in the context of ongoing war events. These practices include reusing sounds for coordinated campaigns, creating audio meme templates for rapid amplification and distribution, and deleting the original sounds to conceal the orchestrators’ identities. We conclude that TikTok’s recommendation system (the “for you” page) acts as a sound space where exposure is strategically navigated through users’ intervention, enabling semi-automated “soft” propaganda to thrive by leveraging its audio features.}

abstract = {Design research has much to contribute to and much to gain from the emerging field of possibility studies. In this short essay, I discuss these opportunities with respect to four topics: (1) processes of mediation and representation, (2) systems perspectives on creative work, (3) methodological options for investigation, and (4) educational challenges that should be addressed. Considering design research’s contributions to each of these topics raises interesting questions that possibility studies might address as it develops. Conversely, possibility studies is already raising issues that design research should also attend to.}

abstract = {The authors present a model of lexical proficiency based on lexical indices related to vocabulary size, depth of lexical knowledge, and accessibility to core lexical items. The lexical indices used in this study come from the computational tool Coh-Metrix and include word length scores, lexical diversity values, word frequency counts, hypernymy values, polysemy values, semantic co-referentiality, word meaningfulness, word concreteness, word imagability, and word familiarity. Human raters evaluated a corpus of 240 written texts using a standardized rubric of lexical proficiency. To ensure a variety of text levels, the corpus comprised 60 texts each from beginning, intermediate, and advanced second language (L2) adult English learners. The L2 texts were collected longitudinally from 10 English learners. In addition, 60 texts from native English speakers were collected. The holistic scores from the trained human raters were then correlated to a variety of lexical indices. The researchers found that lexical diversity, word hypernymy values and content word frequency explain 44% of the variance of the human evaluations of lexical proficiency in the examined writing samples. The findings represent an important step in the development of a model of lexical proficiency that incorporates both vocabulary size and depth of lexical knowledge features.}

abstract = {Recital 33 GDPR has often been interpreted as referring to ‘broad consent’. This version of informed consent was intended to allow data subjects to provide their consent for certain areas of research, or parts of research projects, conditional to the research being in line with ‘recognised ethical standards’. In this article, we argue that broad consent is applicable in the emerging field of Computational Social Science (CSS), which lies at the intersection of data science and social science. However, the lack of recognised ethical standards specific to CSS poses a practical barrier to the use of broad consent in this field and other fields that lack recognised ethical standards. Upon examining existing research ethics standards in social science and data science, we argue that they are insufficient for CSS. We further contend that the fragmentation of European Union (EU) law and research ethics sources makes it challenging to establish universally recognised ethical standards for scientific research. As a result, CSS researchers and other researchers in emerging fields that lack recognised ethical standards are left without sufficient guidance on the use of broad consent as provided for in the GDPR. We conclude that responsible EU bodies should provide additional guidance to facilitate the use of broad consent in CSS research.}

abstract = {People spend most of their time indoors; therefore, maintaining a good indoor air quality and meeting the requirements of comfort and energy efficiency are essential. One of the most widespread strategies to achieve this objective is improving ventilation efficiency; therefore, the main aim of this study was to show an optimization of the ventilation efficiency, in a specific room, considering 47 variations (case studies) in the furniture arrangement. For this purpose, a numerical analysis using computational fluid dynamics techniques, validated by the tracer gas decay technique, was used to assess the distribution of the age of air within the space. The concept of “age of air” was implemented in the computational fluid dynamics code through user-defined functions, using the steady-state method based on the resolution of a transport equation for an additional scalar. Variations up to 5.75% in the ventilation efficiency between the cases studied have been achieved. It is concluded that an improvement up to 1.65% can be obtained when the elements of the study are introduced in a way that facilitates the air movement towards the exhaust; therefore, improvement of the ventilation efficiency through specific furniture distributions is possible, although not significant, according to the outcomes.}

abstract = {Computational design of small molecule putative inhibitors of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is presented. Plk1, which regulates the cell cycle, is often over expressed in cancers. Down regulation of Plk1 has been shown to inhibit tumor progression. Most kinase inhibitors interact with the ATP binding site on Plk1, which is highly conserved. This makes the development of Plk1-specific inhibitors challenging, since different kinases have similar ATP sites. However, Plk1 also contains a unique region called the polo-box domain (PBD), which is absent from other kinases. In this study, the PBD site was used as a target for designed Plk1 putative inhibitors. Common structural features of several experimentally known Plk1 ligands were first identified. The findings were used to design small molecules that specifically bonded Plk1. Drug likeness and possible toxicities of the molecules were investigated. Molecules with no implied toxicities and optimal drug likeness values were used for docking studies. Several molecules were identified that made stable complexes only with Plk1 and LYN kinases, but not with other kinases. One molecule was found to bind exclusively the PBD site of Plk1. Possible utilization of the designed molecules in drugs against cancers with over expressed Plk1 is discussed.}

We find differences between topics in the two periods in each of the journals’ groups and between the two groups themselves. In the European group, we find centrality of topics related to media change and media logic. In the ICA journals, we find a strengthening of scholarly engagement with effects studies. At the same time, we find evidence of erosion of the place of cultural studies as a distinctive research stream.}

This two-dimensional (2D) four-stroke SI engine model simulates the combustion of the fuel, heptane, in the engine cylinder based on realistic boundary conditions. The development of the model helps engineering students better understand the combined effects of chemical reactions, species transport, flow patterns and temperature distributions in the SI engine. This model has been applied in a practical session in an undergraduate engineering course since 2012. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first time that CFD engine models are used as a hands-on tool in IC engine courses. Feedback from students is quite positive.}

abstract = {Broadband noise due to the turbulence-aerofoil interaction, which is also called the leading edge noise, is one of the major noise sources of aircraft (including the engine). To study the noise properties numerically is a popular approach with the increasing power of computers. Conventional approaches of using body-fitted grids at the boundaries would be convoluted due to the complex geometries, which can constrain the efficiency of parametric studies. A promising approach to tackle this issue is to use the immersed boundary method (IBM). Among various IBM variants, the volume penalization (VP) approach employs a masking function to identify the immersed solid boundary, and continuous forcing terms are added to the original flow governing equations to account for the boundary conditions. It is, therefore, efficient and easy to implement into the existing computational aeroacoustics solvers. In this work, the VP-based IBM is used to simulate the leading edge noise by combining with the advanced synthetic turbulence method. The simulations are conducted for both the isolated aerofoils and cascade, and the results are compared with the well-validated body-fitted grid solutions. The viscosity effect is also highlighted by comparing the results obtained by solving both Euler and Navier–Stokes equations.}
