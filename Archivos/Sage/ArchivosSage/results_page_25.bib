abstract = {Highlights We live in a technology-driven age, so the education field must rationally consider chatbots powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Faced with increasing application of AI in education, teachers should be reflective educators, and students should be self-educators. AI chatbots will evolve into a new prosthesis before being institutionalized into the fabric of school education. Reflective educators, institutionalized educators, self-educators foreshadow the future rise of hybrid educators.}

abstract = {Pregnancy can be accompanied by serious health risks to mother and child, such as pre-eclampsia, premature birth and postpartum haemorrhage. Understanding of the normal physiology of uterine function is essential to an improved management of such risks. Here we focus on the physiology of the smooth muscle fibres which make up the bulk of the uterine wall and which generate the forceful contractions that accompany parturition. We survey computational methods that integrate mathematical modelling with data analysis and thereby aid the discovery of new therapeutic targets that, according to clinical needs, can be manipulated to either stop contractions or cause the uterine wall muscle to become active.}

abstract = {Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is commonly associated with decision-making, neurocognitive impairments, and mood and motivational symptoms. However, their relationship may be obscured by traditional scoring methods. Objectives: To study the computational basis underlying decision-making impairments in MS and their interaction with neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric measures. Methods: Twenty-nine MS patients and 26 matched control subjects completed a computer version of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Participants underwent neurocognitive evaluation using an expanded version of the Brief Repeatable Battery. Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis was used to estimate three established computational models to compare parameters between groups. Results: Patients showed increased learning rate and reduced loss-aversion during decision-making relative to control subjects. These alterations were associated with: (1) reduced net gains in the IGT; (2) processing speed, executive functioning and memory impairments; and (3) higher levels of depression and current apathy. Conclusion: Decision-making deficits in MS patients could be described by the interplay between latent computational processes, neurocognitive impairments, and mood/motivational symptoms.}

abstract = {Persuasion is an activity that involves one party trying to induce another party to believe something or to do something. It is an important and multifaceted human facility. Obviously, sales and marketing is heavily dependent on persuasion. But many other activities involve persuasion such as a doctor persuading a patient to drink less alcohol, a road safety expert persuading drivers to not text while driving, or an online safety expert persuading users of social media sites to not reveal too much personal information online. As computing becomes involved in every sphere of life, so too is persuasion a target for applying computer-based solutions. An automated persuasion system (APS) is a system that can engage in a dialogue with a user (the persuadee) in order to persuade the persuadee to do (or not do) some action or to believe (or not believe) something. To do this, an APS aims to use convincing arguments in order to persuade the persuadee. Computational persuasion is the study of formal models of dialogues involving arguments and counterarguments, of user models, and strategies, for APSs. A promising application area for computational persuasion is in behaviour change. Within healthcare organizations, government agencies, and non-governmental agencies, there is much interest in changing behaviour of particular groups of people away from actions that are harmful to themselves and/or to others around them.}

abstract = {Small group researchers are increasingly called to engage the computational sciences. One challenge in answering this call is the lack of information concerning what the study of small groups looks like in these domains. This paper addresses this challenge through a prospecting review of research that computationally models or trains computers to learn small group and team behavior and is published in computing disciplines from 2016 to 2023. This review investigated how groups were modeled, for what purpose, what group elements were modeled, and whether social science informed the model design. Qualitative methods were used to analyze 119 published articles. Suggestions are presented for increasing the influence of small group research on the computational modeling of groups and teams, particularly for researchers with limited access to large research teams or resources. This review helps bridge the gap between small group research and computational sciences to advance the understanding of small groups and teams.}

While the hack transcends existing literatures on the digital and informality, it is a distinctive concept and is being used systematically in new domains. I situate the hack conceptually, outline its empirical and methodological value and propose a framework to research the urban hack. Importantly, it is not just the technologies of hacking but the translation of computational logics to the urban that underpins the importance of the hack, as well as the critical need to set out a research agenda surrounding the hack within urban studies.}

abstract = {The wave loads and the resulting motions of floating wave energy converters are traditionally computed using linear radiation–diffraction methods. Yet for certain cases such as survival conditions, phase control and wave energy converters operating in the resonance region, more complete mathematical models such as computational fluid dynamics are preferred and over the last 5 years, computational fluid dynamics has become more frequently used in the wave energy field. However, rigorous estimation of numerical errors, convergence rates and uncertainties associated with computational fluid dynamics simulations have largely been overlooked in the wave energy sector. In this article, we apply formal verification and validation techniques to computational fluid dynamics simulations of a passively controlled point absorber. The phase control causes the motion response to be highly nonlinear even for almost linear incident waves. First, we show that the computational fluid dynamics simulations have acceptable agreement to experimental data. We then present a verification and validation study focusing on the solution verification covering spatial and temporal discretization, iterative and domain modelling errors. It is shown that the dominating source of errors is, as expected, the spatial discretization, but temporal and iterative errors cannot be neglected. Using hexahedral cells with low aspect ratio and 30 cells per wave height, we obtain results with less than 5% uncertainty in motion response (except for surge) and restraining forces for the buoy without phase control. The amplified nonlinear response due to phase control caused a large increase in numerical uncertainty, illustrating the difficulty to obtain reliable solutions for highly nonlinear responses, and that much denser meshes are required for such cases.}

abstract = {Purpose: This article aims to shed light on a latest education informatization policy blueprint in China, titled Education Informatization 2.0 Action Plan, which was promulgated by the Ministry of Education in China on April 18, 2018. Design/Approach/Methods: The study is an analytical policy review based on the policy documents, theoretical discussion, and development of practice. Findings: This new Chinese education informatization policy was driven by three factors: the promotion of education informatization 1.0 in China, the requirement of education modernization toward 2035, and the response to “Wisdom Education.” The framework for action can be summarized as “One Goal, Three Tasks, and Eight Actions.” The main features involve innovation-driven development rather than technology-driven development, committing to the expansion of digital educational resources rather than the digital presentation of textbooks, and aiming at improving teachers and students’ information literacy rather than the applied skills of information technology. The future vision of the plan involves building new models on talent cultivation, education service, and education governance. The new models on talent cultivation involve establishing “Wisdom Teaching” mode, learning mode, and intelligent learning environment supported by artificial intelligence technology. The new education service models entail building the admission and sharing mechanism of quality educational resources based on National Network for Education and the public service platform and system for educational resources by means of the cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The new education governance models involve achieving precise, flat, and humanized education governance. Originality/Value: This article entails expounding the motivation, framework for action, main features, and vision of the education informatization 2.0 in China, which will be helpful for learning and understanding the current background, stage, and future path of China’s education informatization.}
