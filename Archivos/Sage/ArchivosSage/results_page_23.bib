abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a prominent topic in K-12 education recently. However, pedagogical design has remained a major challenge, especially among young learners. Guided by the Zone of Proximal Development theory and AI education research literature, this design-based study proposes an analogy-based pedagogical approach to support AI teaching and learning in upper primary education. This pedagogical approach is centered on human–AI comparison, where humans are gradually shifted from an analogue to a contrast to make visible the attributes, mechanisms, and processes of AI. To evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experimental study with mixed methods was conducted. The quantitative comparison shows that the participants in the experimental group learning with the analogy-based pedagogical approach significantly outperformed their peers with the conventional direct instructional approach in all three dimensions of AI knowledge, skills, and ethical awareness. Qualitative analyses further reveal its pedagogical benefits, including demystifying AI through relatable and engaging learning, supporting student comprehension and skill mastery, and nurturing critical thinking and attitudes. The analogy-based approach contributes to the field of K-12 AI education with an age-appropriate, child-friendly pedagogical approach. Notably, AI education should prioritize teaching for student understanding, and AI should be recognized as an independent subject with interdisciplinary applications.}

abstract = {This article describes PSI theory, which is a formalized computational architecture of human psychological processes. In contrast to other existing theories, PSI theory not only models cognitive, but also motivational and emotional processes and their interactions. The article starts with a brief overview of the theory showing the connections between its different parts. We then discuss the theory’s components in greater detail. Key constructs and processes are the five basic human needs, the satisfaction of needs using the cognitive system, including perception, schemas in memory, planning, and action. Furthermore, emotions are defined and the role of emotions in cognitive and motivational processes is elaborated, referring to a specific example. The neural basis of the PSI theory is also highlighted referring to the “quad structure,” to specific brain areas, and to thinking as scanning in a neural network. Finally, some evidence for the validity of the theory is provided.}

abstract = {Mass capture ratio of a hypersonic air intake is one of the most important performance parameters. However, no a priori estimate of its value exists for use in initial design exercise of a hypersonic vehicle. In the present work, an air intake of a non-axisymmetric scramjet engine, designed using stream thrust methodology, is studied using computational fluid dynamic techniques. A large amount of air mass flow rate is observed to spill from the sides, which is not accounted for in the initial design phase. In absence of even an approximate estimate of this spillage, computational fluid dynamic studies become the only available tool to evaluate the mass capture ratio. Simulations are also carried out with a side wall at the intake to stop spillage. Although mass capture ratio and static pressure at combustor entry improve, deterioration in other flow parameters such as static temperature, Mach number and total pressure is observed.}

abstract = {The University of Florida Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering recently created a new senior technical elective in the field of computational fluid dynamics. The main objectives of the class are learning the process of computational fluid dynamics, skepticism, a course project that uses a popular commercial solver, and a course project that involves programming a simplified computational fluid dynamics code. The course covers introductory material, history, grid generation, numerics, equations of motion, boundary conditions, solvers, turbulence models, visualization, and a number of special topics. Skepticism is enforced throughout the course and forces students to justify the validity of their approach and question numerically generated results. Students in the class undertake a course project to predict a fundamental flow-field and compare predictions with excellent measurements from the open literature. They must also create a simplified computational fluid dynamics code to predict turbulent boundary layer flow. Students have integrated these lessons within student groups across the University of Florida. The emphasis of the course is on skepticism and increasing integration with the curriculum and student group activities. We present the class philosophy for teaching undergraduate computational fluid dynamics and the outcomes of the newly developed course.}

abstract = {The use of a pedagogical approach mediated transfer with the bridging method has been successful in facilitating the transitions from block-based to text-based programming languages. Nevertheless, there is a lack of research addressing the impact of this transfer on programming misconceptions during the transition. The way programming concepts are taught to K-12 learners can later result in misconceptions for adult learners. The main objective was to examine the impact of mediated transfer using the bridging method pedagogical approach on the prevalence of programming misconceptions. We conducted a quasi-experimental study in school settings during informatics (computer science) classes among 163 sixth-grade students. The control group received traditional programming lectures using the text-based programming language, Python. Conversely, the experimental group utilized a mediated transfer pedagogical approach by starting with the block-based programming language MakeCode for micro:bit before transitioning to the text-based Python. Our findings indicate that the experimental group significantly reduced programming misconceptions in fundamental programming concepts: variables, sequencing, selection, and loops - compared to the control group. This suggests that the use of block-based programming language as an initial step in programming education, followed by a structured transition to text-based programming language, can effectively mitigate common misconceptions among K-12 learners.}

abstract = {Computer-based design and fabrication systems in architecture contain modes of operation and preferences that often constrain tectonic possibilities in design and construction. These predispositions neglect architecture’s cultural and material dimensions, resulting in universalizing tectonics that erase nuances of place, culture, and expression in design. How may we celebrate local tectonic languages while also revisiting them through computer-based systems in architecture? The project examined here highlights novel possibilities for cultural expression and craftsmanship through computational design methods, retaining the expressive potential of a local craft while de-familiarizing its cultural context. I analyze how shape grammars and digital fabrication methods deployed in design, de-familiarizes the craft of wire-bending in costuming in the Trinidad Carnival. I present and apply new rules for the craft’s computational description based on material tests and an architectural application to expand discourses on critical regionalism. I adopt Tabbarah’s term “computational regionalism” to describe this process and elaborate it as a five-step sequence. Computational regionalism employs computational methods to translate local craft knowledge and tectonic languages into new interpretations and poetics of construction. Its process of creative de-familiarization raises critical questions about the local and the universal.}

abstract = {In this paper, we propose to use a computational method of chaos control to simulate complex experimental spectra. This computational chaos control technique is based on the Ott–Grebogi–York (OGY) method. We chose the logistic map as the base mathematical model for the development of our work. For the numeric part, we created arbitrary precision algorithms to generate the solutions. This way, we completely eliminated any degradation of chaos from our results. These algorithms were also necessary for the proper perturbation process that the computational chaos control method requires. We control the chaos of the logistic map in two cases of Period 1 and one case of Period 2 to demonstrate that our control method works. The behavior of a complex experimental spectrum was taken and numerically simulated. The simulated spectrum was obtained by controlling the chaos of the logistic map in a variable way with the methods proposed in this work. Our results show that it is possible to simulate very complicated experimental spectra by computationally controlling the chaos of an equation unrelated to the experimental system.}

abstract = {Computational Biology is a fast-growing field that is enriched by different data-driven methodological approaches and by findings and applications in a broad range of biological areas. Fundamental to these approaches are the mathematical and computational models used to describe the different states at microscopic (for example a biochemical reaction), mesoscopic (the signalling effects at tissue level), and macroscopic levels (physiological and pathological effects) of biological processes. In this paper we address the problem of combining two powerful classes of methodologies: Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) methods which are now producing a revolution in biotechnology and medicine, and Petri Nets (PNs) which allow system generalisation and are central to various mathematical treatments, for example Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) specification of the biosystem under study. While the former is limited to modelling metabolic networks, i.e. does not account for intermittent dynamical signalling events, the latter is hampered by the need for a large amount of metabolic data. A first result presented in this paper is the identification of three types of cross-talks between PNs and FBA methods and their dependencies on available data. We exemplify our insights with the analysis of a pancreatic cancer model. We discuss how our reasoning framework provides a biologically and mathematically grounded decision making setting for the integration of regulatory, signalling, and metabolic networks and greatly increases model interpretability and reusability. We discuss how the parameters of PN and FBA models can be tuned and combined together so to highlight the computational effort needed to perform this task. We conclude with speculations and suggestions on this new promising research direction.}
