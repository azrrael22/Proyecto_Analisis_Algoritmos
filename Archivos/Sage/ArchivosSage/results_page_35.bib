abstract = {The question of whether [CH2OH]+ should be described as the hydroxymethyl cation, +CH2OH, or protonated formaldehyde, CH2=OH+, is reconsidered in the light of experimental information and new computational evidence. Previous arguments that the charge distribution in [CH2OH]+ may be probed by considering the incremental stabilisation of [CH2OH]+ induced by homologation on carbon (to give [CH3CHOH]+) or oxygen (to produce [CH2OCH3]+) are critically examined. Cation stabilisation energies are shown to be better indicators of the nature of these oxonium ions. Further insight into the structure of larger CnH2n+1O+ oxonium ions is obtained by considering the site of protonation of enol ethers and related species. Computational information, including AIM (Atoms and Molecules) and NBA (Natural Bond Analysis) charges on the carbon and oxygen atoms in [CH2OH]+ and related species, is considered critically. Particular attention is focused on the calculated bond lengths and barriers to rotation about the C–O bond(s) in [CH2OH]+, [CH3CHOH]+, [(CH3)2COH]+, CH3OH and [CH2OCH3]+ and the C–N bond in [CH2NH2]+. Trends in these data are consistent with appreciable π-bonding only in the C–O connections which correspond to the C=O bond in the parent aldehyde or ketone from which the oxonium ion may be considered to be derived by protonation or alkyl cationation.}

abstract = {Conflicts involving caste issues, mainly concerning the lowest caste rights, pervade modern Indian society. Caste affiliation, being rigorously enforced by the society, is an official contemporary reality. Although caste identity is a major social discrimination, it also serves as a necessary condition for affirmative action like reservation policy. In this article, we perform an original and rigorous analysis of the discourse involving the theme “caste” in India newspapers. To this purpose, we have implemented a computational analysis over a big dataset of the 2016 and 2017 editions of three major Indian newspapers to determine the most salient themes associated with “caste” in the news. We have used an original mix of state-of-the-art algorithms, including those based on statistical distributions and two-layer neural networks, to detect the relevant topics in the news and characterize their linguistic context. We concluded that there is an excessive association between lower castes, victimization, and social unrest in the news that does not adequately cover the reports on other aspects of their life and personal identity, thus reinforcing conflict, while attenuating the vocality and agency of a large section of the population. From our conclusion, we propose a positive discrimination policy in the newsroom.}

abstract = {Studies of scientific and technological thinking can be organized via a taxonomy of methodological approaches that reveal areas for further study. Dunbar provides such a taxonomy, using biological methods like in vivo and in vitro as examples. In vitro corresponds to laboratory simulations of scientific thinking; In Vivo corresponds to field studies of actual scientists and inventors. Dunbar expands this taxonomy to incorporate historical studies of scientists and inventors, computer simulation and the possibility of neurological studies. These methods can and should be combined: Computational simulations are frequently based on historical case-studies, for example. In this article, a wide range of studies are classified according to this taxonomy, and their main points summarized. Consideration is also given to studies of scientific and technological thinking in collaborative dyads and teams. The article concludes with suggestions for future research.}

abstract = {Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) operation for coronary artery disease with different types of grafts has a large clinical application world wide. Immediately after this operation patients are usually relieved of their chest pain and have improved cardiac function. However, after a while, these bypass grafts may fail due to for example, neointimal hyperplasia or thrombosis. One of the causes for this bypass graft failure is assumed to be the blood flow with low wall shear stress. The aim of this research is to estimate the wall shear stress in a graft and thus to locate areas were wall shear stress is low. This was done with the help of a blood flow computer model. Postoperative biplane angiograms of the graft were recorded, and from these the three-dimensional geometry of the graft was reconstructed and imported into the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program FLUENT. The stationary diastolic flow through the grafts was calculated, and the wall shear stress distribution was estimated. This procedure was carried out for one native vessel and two different types of bypass grafts. One bypass graft was a saphenous vein and the other one was a varicose saphenous vein encased in a fine, flexible metal mesh. The mesh was attached to give the graft a defined diameter. The computational results show that each graft has distinct areas of low wall shear stress. The graft with the metal mesh has an area of low wall shear stress (< 1 Pa, stationary flow), which is four times smaller than the respective areas in the other graft and in the native vessel. This is thought to be caused by the smaller and more uniform diameter of the metal mesh-reinforced graft.}

abstract = {The design of metallic card clothing, which is one of the most important devices in the textile industry, has always been based on operational experience. With the development of types of fibers and the requirements for the quality of yarns, those principles concluded by engineers seem to be losing their efficiency. Recent research found that airflow played an important role in the card process, which means airflow should be carefully studied. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation greatly helps in the analysis of airflow because the gauge between carding elements is too narrow to put in any measuring device. In the present study, with the help of CFD simulation, the air around different carding clothing with varied tooth depth was analyzed. It was concluded that the carding efficiency improvement in card clothing with lower tooth depth may be related to more concentrated air velocity at the tooth tips. This resulted in more probabilities that fibers would get through the cylinder surface at the teeth tips, so that the fibers could be caught by flat-top needles more efficiently. With this assumption, a new generation of card clothing called “double teeth” containing two teeth in a single section has been invented. The new configuration design of card clothing was then applied in several spinning mills on an industrial scale for experiments. The results showed about a 30% improvement in production at the same quality level as conventional card clothing, which implied the usefulness of the newly applied principles related to airflow. Despite the difficulty in the study of the complex carding process, the new airflow analysis method has shown an optional and worthwhile way of thinking that could make a difference in future research in the textile industry.}

abstract = {Predictive toxicology plays a critical role in reducing the failure rate of new drugs in pharmaceutical research and development. Despite recent gains in our understanding of drug-induced toxicity, however, it is urgent that the utility and limitations of our current predictive tools be determined in order to identify gaps in our understanding of mechanistic and chemical toxicology. Using recently published computational regression analyses of in vitro and in vivo toxicology data, it will be demonstrated that significant gaps remain in early safety screening paradigms. More strategic analyses of these data sets will allow for a better understanding of their domain of applicability and help identify those compounds that cause significant in vivo toxicity but which are currently mis-predicted by in silico and in vitro models. These ‘outliers’ and falsely predicted compounds are metaphorical lighthouses that shine light on existing toxicological knowledge gaps, and it is essential that these compounds are investigated if attrition is to be reduced significantly in the future. As such, the modern computational toxicologist is more productively engaged in understanding these gaps and driving investigative toxicology towards addressing them.}

abstract = {This paper introduces a computational aesthetics framework utilizing computer vision (CV) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the aesthetic preferences of groups of people for architecture. It relies on part-to-whole theories from aesthetics and cognitive psychology. A survey of a group of people on preferences of images is held to record an average hedonic response (AHR). CV algorithms MSER and SAM recognize parts in images. Birkhoff’s aesthetic measure formula is adapted by employing the number of parts and their connections. These quantities are used as input layers of an ANN, and the AHR is the target output. The ANN evaluates images to output a predicted hedonic response (PHR), which is tested as a criterion in parametric design space navigation and in mapping the latent space of GANs. We conclude that such a framework is a heuristic method for better understanding the design and latent spaces and exploring designs.}

The uniqueness of this article stems from the inclusion of comprehensive information on computational progress in the field of fusion-based, sintering-based, and mechanical deformation-based AM. A computational model’s role in determining the process framework for the desired outcome of the set properties of the AM components is recognised while presenting the process-microstructure maps, thereby appraising computational ability towards the qualification of products.

abstract = {How do children learn to read? How do deficits in various components of the reading network affect learning outcomes? How does remediating one or several components change reading performance? In this article, we summarize what is known about learning to read and how this can be formalized in a developmentally plausible computational model of reading acquisition. The model is used to understand normal and impaired reading development (dyslexia). In particular, we show that it is possible to simulate individual learning trajectories and intervention outcomes on the basis of three component skills: orthography, phonology, and vocabulary. We therefore advocate a multifactorial computational approach to understanding reading that has practical implications for dyslexia and intervention.}
