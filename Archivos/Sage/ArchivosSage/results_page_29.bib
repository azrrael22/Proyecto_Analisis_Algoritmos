abstract = {With the development of the 4th Industrial Revolution (4th IR), its emerging technologies and skills; there is a mismatch between 4th IR, and the skills needed by information professionals to survive. This paper bridges the gap based on the skills needed to survive and provide possible solutions to challenges faced by information professionals, which will in turn help to reduce the number of unemployed, semi-employed, non-employed, and provide economic empowerment among information professionals in this new revolution. Information professionals should adopt the missing middle model/techniques in organization which asserts that robots, by and large, will not be taking our jobs; instead, human Machine collaboration will reconfigure some of our work, making and make human skills more unique and important than ever.}

This article describes three problems that need to be addressed in order for such models to become effective tools for formulating new social theory and informing policy debates and suggests approaches to meeting them. These issues are computational epistemology, research methodology, and software technology. These innovations augment Agent Based Modeling to create an effective new tool base to help better understand complex social systems.}

abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to examine the structure and development of algebraic thinking across multiple dimensions. An algebraic thinking test was administered to 803 students aged 10–13 years old. One hundred and one students of different performance outcomes in the algebraic thinking test participated in semi-structured clinical interviews in order to develop further insights into students’ strategies and difficulties. The results confirmed the multifaceted nature of algebraic thinking and showed that algebraic thinking consists of three aspects: reasoning about covariation, generalization of arithmetic properties and abilities directly related to algebraic syntax. Each one of these aspects is composed of specific algebraic thinking abilities, such as modelling relations using algebraic symbols. Four groups of students of different algebraic thinking profiles were identified: ‘pre-algebraic’, ‘protoalgebraic-procedural’, ‘relational-symbolic algebraic thinking’ and ‘structural-global algebraic thinking’. The results also supported the presence of a consistent trend in the difficulty level across the algebraic thinking abilities, which suggests a specific developmental trend from a more procedural perspective of algebraic thinking to a more structural one.}

In order to eliminate the burden of considering all multidimensional design aspects at the same time, this research presents a three-bodied computational method for locating the spaces of the given architectural design program in a project site, according to the defined list of design objectives and criteria. Besides the determination of the layout according to the requirements of the spatial elements, this research proposes an integration of the space syntax theory’s analytical compounds in terms of Justified Graph Analysis and Integration Values as the fitness criteria for the multi-objective evolutionary optimization in the computational model. To satisfy the integrity levels of each various characterized element within site organization, that are implied inherently by the architectural design program and generate a sustainable space network layout for the project site.}

abstract = {Objective: We developed a computational model of the effects of sleep deprivation on the vigilance decrement by employing the methods of system dynamics modeling. Background: Situations that require sustained attention for a prolonged duration can cause a decline in cognitive performance, the so-called vigilance decrement. One factor that should influence the vigilance decrement is fatigue in the form of sleep deprivation. Method: We employed the methods of system dynamics modeling (numerical-integration techniques for modeling complex feedback systems) to create a computational model of the vigilance decrement. We then simulated the computational effects of sleep deprivation on the behavior of that model, using empirical data obtained from the literature for calibrating such effects. Results: Sleep deprivation of 2 hr over a 14-day period should produce an additional decline of 9% in detection performance over that found with the typical vigilance decrement, whereas 4 hr of sleep deprivation over 14 days should produce an additional decline of 14% in detection performance. Conclusion: With respect to dual-process theory, it is through its deleterious effects on analytical cognition that sleep deprivation should impact the vigilance decrement. Application: Such computational modeling may be advantageous for human-machine teaming by theoretically allowing a future autonomous software agent to anticipate the decline of human performance and compensate accordingly.}

This study provides an overview of the computational intelligence methods developed for the corrosion damage assessment of aerospace materials and structures. Specifically, cellular automata modeling of corrosion pit initiation and growth, wavelet based image processing methods for corrosion damage assessment, and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for material loss and residual strength predictions. In addition, ANN based prediction of life due to corrosion-fatigue conditions are considered and presented. Results obtained from selected computational intelligence methods are compared to the existing alternate solutions and experimental data. The results presented illustrate the feasibility of computational intelligence methods for modeling and assessing the corrosion health of aging aircraft structures and materials.}

abstract = {Digital trace data and computational methods are increasingly being used by researchers to study mental health phenomena (i.e. psychopathology and well-being) in social media. Computer-assisted mental health research is not simply a continuation of previous studies, but rather raises ethical, conceptual and methodological issues that are critical to behavioural science but have not yet been systematically explored. Based on a systematic review of n = 147 studies, we reveal a multidisciplinary field of research that has grown immensely since 2010, spanning the humanities, social sciences, and engineering. We find that a substantial majority of studies in our sample lack a standardized form of ethical consideration, focus on specific constructs and have a rather narrow focus on specific social media platforms. Based on our findings, we discuss how computational elements have influenced mental health research, highlight academic gaps and suggest promising directions for future studies.}

abstract = {Background. Learning programming is a cognitively demanding field of study accompanied with various difficulties. Although there is a high demand in the market for programmers, software analysts and engineers, a high dropout rate is recorded in relevant fields of study. Serious games are a promising means of engaging students in learning programming by giving them more incentives and making the process of learning programming concepts and languages more entertaining. Aim. This article introduces a new serious game called PY-RATE ADVENTURES, which aims to assist young students in their introduction to the basic programming concepts using Python. The game does not have any prerequisites and is suitable for players with no previous knowledge of programming. This article aims to present important information regarding the analysis, design and pilot evaluation of PY-RATE ADVENTURES. Method. The game was evaluated by 31 people that had recently graduated or were students of an Interdepartmental Programme of Postgraduate Studies in Information Systems. The participants voluntarily played the game and answered a questionnaire based on the MEEGA+ model, after their hands on experience with the game. This questionnaire’s purpose was to evaluate PY-RATE ADVENTURES in terms of perceived player experience and short-term learning. Results. The participants positively evaluated the game almost in all the elements of player experience. Furthermore, the majority of the users consider that the game helped them to learn basic programming concepts in Python and stated that they would prefer to learn programming with this game rather than other teaching methods. Conclusion. The positive results of the pilot evaluation give us the motivation to proceed and evaluate the game with students in secondary education, in order to extract stronger and generalisable conclusions regarding the impact of the game as an educational tool for learning programming concepts.}
