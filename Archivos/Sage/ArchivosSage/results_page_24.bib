abstract = {The substantial volume, continued growth, and resulting complexity of the scientific literature not only increases the need for systematic, replicable, and rigorous literature reviews, but also highlights the natural limits of human researchers’ information processing capabilities. In search of a solution to this dilemma, computational techniques are beginning to support human researchers in synthesizing large bodies of literature. However, actionable methodological guidance on how to design, conduct, and document such computationally augmented literature reviews is lacking to date. We respond by introducing and defining computational literature reviews (CLRs) as a new review method and put forward a six-step roadmap, covering the CLR process from identifying the review objectives to selecting algorithms and reporting findings. We make the CLR method accessible to novice and expert users alike by identifying critical design decisions and typical challenges for each step and provide practical guidelines for tailoring the CLR method to four conceptual review goals. As such, we present CLRs as a literature review method where the choice, design, and implementation of a CLR are guided by specific review objectives, methodological capabilities, and resource constraints of the human researcher.}

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the correlational and causal relationship between middle school students’ entrepreneurial competencies and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) attitudes. A total of 648 middle school students (seventh and eighth grade) participated in this study. STEM attitude scale and two entrepreneurial competency scales that were developed in different studies in the literature were used as data collection tools. In addition, a simple regression, a multiple regression and a stepwise multiple regression analysis were executed to analyse the data. The correlational analysis showed that there was a moderate level, positive correlation between the STEM attitudes of students and their overall entrepreneurial competencies. Also, the multiple regression analysis showed that entrepreneurial competencies consisting of professionalism, risk-taking, creativity and tenacity explained 41% of the change in STEM attitude. The stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that professionalism predicted the most the STEM attitude statistically more.}

The results reinforce contingency theory and suggest particular characteristics of different project environments that make one form relatively more or less appropriate than another. Practically, the answers to the research questions have direct and immediate application to project/portfolio managers and senior executives. Theoretically, broad classes of organizations are generalized and prescribe a novel set of organizational design guides.}

abstract = {Mass capture ratio of a hypersonic air intake is one of the most important performance parameters. However, no a priori estimate of its value exists for use in initial design exercise of a hypersonic vehicle. In the present work, an air intake of a non-axisymmetric scramjet engine, designed using stream thrust methodology, is studied using computational fluid dynamic techniques. A large amount of air mass flow rate is observed to spill from the sides, which is not accounted for in the initial design phase. In absence of even an approximate estimate of this spillage, computational fluid dynamic studies become the only available tool to evaluate the mass capture ratio. Simulations are also carried out with a side wall at the intake to stop spillage. Although mass capture ratio and static pressure at combustor entry improve, deterioration in other flow parameters such as static temperature, Mach number and total pressure is observed.}

In this article, we review a selection of published research regarding computational methods, primarily from systems biology, which support translational research from the molecular level to the bedside, with a focus on applications in trauma and critical care. Trauma is the leading cause of mortality in Americans younger than 45 years, and its rapid progression offers both opportunities and challenges for computational analysis of trends in molecular patterns associated with outcomes and therapeutic interventions. This review presents methods and domain-specific examples that may inspire the development of new algorithms and computational methods that use both molecular and clinical data for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in disease progression.}

abstract = {Computer-based design and fabrication systems in architecture contain modes of operation and preferences that often constrain tectonic possibilities in design and construction. These predispositions neglect architecture’s cultural and material dimensions, resulting in universalizing tectonics that erase nuances of place, culture, and expression in design. How may we celebrate local tectonic languages while also revisiting them through computer-based systems in architecture? The project examined here highlights novel possibilities for cultural expression and craftsmanship through computational design methods, retaining the expressive potential of a local craft while de-familiarizing its cultural context. I analyze how shape grammars and digital fabrication methods deployed in design, de-familiarizes the craft of wire-bending in costuming in the Trinidad Carnival. I present and apply new rules for the craft’s computational description based on material tests and an architectural application to expand discourses on critical regionalism. I adopt Tabbarah’s term “computational regionalism” to describe this process and elaborate it as a five-step sequence. Computational regionalism employs computational methods to translate local craft knowledge and tectonic languages into new interpretations and poetics of construction. Its process of creative de-familiarization raises critical questions about the local and the universal.}

abstract = {The proliferation of digital data has been the impetus for the emergence of a new discipline for the study of social life: ‘computational social science’. Much research in this field is founded on the premise that society is a complex system with emergent structures that can be modeled or reconstructed through digital data. This paper suggests that computational social science serves practical and legitimizing functions for digital capitalism in much the same way that neoclassical economics does for neoliberalism. In recognition of this homology, this paper develops a critique of the complexity perspective of computational social science and argues for a heterodox computational social science founded on the meta-theory of critical realism that is critical, methodological pluralist, interpretative and explanative. This implies diverting computational social science’ computational methods and digital data so as to not be aimed at identifying invariant laws of social life, or optimizing state and corporate practices, but to instead be used as part of broader research strategies to identify contingent patterns, develop conjunctural explanations, and propose qualitatively different ways of organizing social life.}

abstract = {Robotics education has gradually been emphasized in contemporary school curricula; however, assessment tools for robotics learning are still limited. Based on Bloom’s Taxonomy of educational objectives, this study aimed to develop the Robotics Learning Self-Efficacy Scale (RLSES) with a two-level construct of five dimensions for assessing students’ self-efficacy for learning robotics. A total of 181 elementary, junior high and senior high school students (5th–12th graders) with robotics learning experience were selected as the sample of this study. A questionnaire including 32 candidate items designed for the initial version of the RLSES was administered to the sample. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted and, finally, 16 items were drawn for the final RLSES under five subscales (Comprehension, Practice, Analysis, Application, and Collaboration), with a total explained variance of 85.28%. The Cronbach’s alpha reliability was .97 for the overall scale, ranging from .87 to .95 for the subscales. The inter-correlation analysis showed evidence of discriminant validity. Regression analysis results supported that Practice and Comprehension self-efficacy were significant predictors of Analysis, Application, and Collaboration self-efficacy, confirming the two-level (2 × 3) construct of the RLSES. Significant differences among school levels were found and are discussed.}

abstract = {Purpose: This article aims to shed light on a latest education informatization policy blueprint in China, titled Education Informatization 2.0 Action Plan, which was promulgated by the Ministry of Education in China on April 18, 2018. Design/Approach/Methods: The study is an analytical policy review based on the policy documents, theoretical discussion, and development of practice. Findings: This new Chinese education informatization policy was driven by three factors: the promotion of education informatization 1.0 in China, the requirement of education modernization toward 2035, and the response to “Wisdom Education.” The framework for action can be summarized as “One Goal, Three Tasks, and Eight Actions.” The main features involve innovation-driven development rather than technology-driven development, committing to the expansion of digital educational resources rather than the digital presentation of textbooks, and aiming at improving teachers and students’ information literacy rather than the applied skills of information technology. The future vision of the plan involves building new models on talent cultivation, education service, and education governance. The new models on talent cultivation involve establishing “Wisdom Teaching” mode, learning mode, and intelligent learning environment supported by artificial intelligence technology. The new education service models entail building the admission and sharing mechanism of quality educational resources based on National Network for Education and the public service platform and system for educational resources by means of the cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The new education governance models involve achieving precise, flat, and humanized education governance. Originality/Value: This article entails expounding the motivation, framework for action, main features, and vision of the education informatization 2.0 in China, which will be helpful for learning and understanding the current background, stage, and future path of China’s education informatization.}
