article,doi:10.1177/2053951715622512,"This article considers the issue of opacity as a problem for socially consequential mechanisms of classification and ranking, such as spam filters, credit card fraud detection, search engines, news trends, market segmentation and advertising, insurance or loan qualification, and credit scoring. These mechanisms of classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms, and in many cases on machine learning algorithms to do this work. In this article, I draw a distinction between three forms of opacity: (1) opacity as intentional corporate or state secrecy, (2) opacity as technical illiteracy, and (3) an opacity that arises from the characteristics of machine learning algorithms and the scale required to apply them usefully. The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves. I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight code audit. I argue that recognizing the distinct forms of opacity that may be coming into play in a given application is a key to determining which of a variety of technical and non-technical solutions could help to prevent harm.",Jenna Burrell,10.1177/2053951715622512,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/2053951715622512,Big Data & Society,1,2053951715622512,How the machine ‘thinks’: Understanding opacity in machine learning algorithms,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/2053951715622512,3,2016a

A major unsolved challenge in this kind of social science research is to devise a systematic way to compare, contrast, and communicate different models of social dynamics along relevant dimensions and characteristics, given the inherent complexity of most computational agent-based models. This article proposes a viable systematic framework for comparing models and illustrates its application using some of the models that Mel helped inspire and develop as senior project participant.",Claudio Cioffi-Revilla,10.1177/1069397110393894,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1069397110393894,Cross-Cultural Research,2,208–230,Comparing Agent-Based Computational Simulation Models in Cross-Cultural Research,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1069397110393894,45,2011b

article,doi:10.1177/14782103231183485,"The Computer Science (CS) for All national movement is increasingly relying on state-level change to broaden participation in computing. To foster an environment in which all students have opportunities to thrive in CS education, policy action is necessary to help create the learning conditions for success. CS education in California has grown substantially in the last decade, yet opportunity gaps remain for young women and Black, Latinx, and Native American students. Early grassroots efforts to advance equity in computing evolved into the Computer Science for California coalition of K–16 educators, industry leaders, and other equity advocates to promote the growth of equity-minded teaching and learning opportunities in K–12 CS education. New policies at the state level reflect an increasing commitment among Sacramento policymakers to expand CS education. Yet troubling disparities in CS access and success continue to exist between traditionally advantaged students and their historically underserved peers. By drawing on interviews with 20 individuals involved in CS education policy, this study illuminates the contributing factors to recent policy successes and considerations for achieving further progress. Interviewees described the importance of tapping into the values of influential decision makers, educating policymakers about the benefits of CS education, and identifying the problems and solutions that require policy attention. To build the capacity of key policy actors in making informed decisions, this research demonstrates the continued value of providing useful information, developing relationships with policymakers, and creating resources that are easy to consume and understand. The interviews also suggest that attention to funding, disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, equity, and ongoing stakeholder support will shape prospects for CS education policy success moving forward.",Julie Flapan and Joel Knudson and Candice Handjojo and Ashley Sunde and Roxana Hadad,10.1177/14782103231183485,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/14782103231183485,Policy Futures in Education,0,14782103231183484,Power surge: How a multistakeholder coalition promotes equity in computer science education policy,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/14782103231183485,0,2023d
article,doi:10.1177/1077546318788405,"The complex nature of the tire/road noise generation process makes it difficult to isolate and study each mechanism individually. This paper presents an experimental and numerical investigation of air-borne tire noise generation mechanisms for a realistic tire. Experimentally, a single slot is cut into the tire and the noise data are measured and studied. Air-borne noise is isolated by filling the slot with foam and comparing the resulting frequency spectra. Numerically, a previously developed computational fluid dynamics tire noise prediction model is employed to predict the air-borne noise for the same tire, under similar operating conditions. A direct comparison between the experimental and computational results is also presented in terms of pressure time traces and spectral characteristics. Comparisons indicate that the computational model is capable of predicting the noise generated by the air pockets in the tire. While providing a deeper understanding of the causes of air-borne noise, this paper also aims to demonstrate the use of a computational tool that can be used to obtain a reasonably accurate prediction of air-borne tire noise.",Prashanta Gautam and Yousof Azizi and Abhilash J.

article,doi:10.1177/0040517515586162,"A three-dimensional computational model is established to simulate the air flow patterns in the rotor spinning unit of a rotor spinning machine. The effects of rotor speed, rotor diameter and rotor slide wall angle on air flow characteristics and hence yarn properties are investigated. The airstream accelerates from the transfer channel inlet to the outlet. There are velocity differences in both the cross-section and along the transfer channel, causing hooked fibers to straighten. The airstream swirls around the rotor at a high speed. However, vortices that can cause fiber curving and buckling are formed inside the rotor. The effect of rotor speed is significant. There are more vortices near the wall at a lower rotor speed, while too large a rotor speed can lead to an excessive centrifugal force, thus increasing yarn breakages. The rotor diameter affects the flow characteristics in a way similar to that of rotor speed. As a smaller slide wall angle generates higher velocities in the transfer channel and more stable velocities in the rotor groove, a small angle is preferable. Computational modeling has provided a useful insight into the rotor spinning flow pattern, thus it can be used to optimize the rotor design to produce better rotor spun yarn.",HT Lin and YC Zeng and J Wang,10.1177/0040517515586162,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0040517515586162,Textile Research Journal,2,115–126,Computational simulation of air flow in the rotor spinning unit,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0040517515586162,86,2016f
article,doi:10.1177/0731948719865499,"The purpose of the study was to compare the deficit profiles of two important types of mathematics difficulties. Three cognitive measures (working memory, processing speed, and reasoning), two mathematics measures (numerical facts retrieval and mathematics vocabulary), and reading comprehension were assessed among 237 Chinese fourth-grade students, among whom 28 were classified as students with only computational difficulties (CD), 34 were classified as having only word problem-solving difficulties (WPD), 20 were classified as students with computational and word problem-solving difficulties (CD + WPD), and 43 typically developing (TD) peers. Multivariate analysis showed that, compared with TD, CD was associated with weakness in numerical working memory; WPD was associated with weakness in reading comprehension; both CD and WPD were associated with weakness in mathematics vocabulary. However, CD and WPD did not differ from each other on any of those profiling measures. Implications for understanding mathematics competence and identification of mathematics difficulties are discussed.",Xin Lin and Peng Peng and Hongjing Luo,10.1177/0731948719865499,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0731948719865499,Learning Disability Quarterly,2,110–122,The Deficit Profile of Elementary Students With Computational Difficulties Versus Word Problem-Solving Difficulties,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0731948719865499,44,2021g
article,doi:10.1177/0954410016671343,"A fluid–structure interaction numerical simulation was performed to investigate the flow field around a flexible flapping wing using an in-house developed computational fluid dynamics/computational structural dynamics solver. The three-dimensional (3D) fluid–structure interaction of the flapping locomotion was predicted by loosely coupling preconditioned Navier–Stokes solutions and non-linear co-rotational structural solutions. The computational structural dynamic solver was specifically developed for highly flexible flapping wings by considering large geometric non-linear characteristics. The high fidelity of the developed methodology was validated by benchmark tests. Then, an analysis of flexible flapping wings was carried out with a specific focus on the unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms and effects of flexion on flexible flapping wings. Results demonstrate that the flexion will introduce different flow fields, and thus vary thrust generation and pressure distribution significantly. In the meanwhile, relationship between flapping frequency and flexion plays an important role on efficiency. Therefore, appropriate combination of frequency and flexion of flexible flapping wings provides higher efficiency. This study may give instruction for further design of flexible flapping wings.",Long Liu and Hongda Li and Haisong Ang and Tianhang Xiao,10.1177/0954410016671343,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0954410016671343,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering",1,85–95,Numerical investigation of flexible flapping wings using computational fluid dynamics/computational structural dynamics method,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0954410016671343,232,2018h
article,doi:10.1177/1059712309342757,"In this article we propose a computational model that describes how observed behavior can influence an observer’s own behavior, including the acquisition of new task descriptions. The sources of influence on our model’s behavior are: beliefs about the world’s possible states and actions causing transitions between them; baseline preferences for certain actions; a variable tendency to infer and share goals in observed behavior; and a variable tendency to act efficiently to reach rewarding states. Acting on these premises, our model is able to replicate key empirical studies of social learning in children and chimpanzees. We demonstrate how a simple artificial system can account for a variety of biological social transfer phenomena, such as goal-inference and over-imitation, by taking into account action constraints and incomplete knowledge about the world dynamics.",Manuel Lopes and Francisco S.

CFD is used to simulate the airwakes of landing helicopter assault (LHA) and landing platform dock-17 (LPD-17) classes of ships. The focus is on capturing the massively separated flow from sharp edges of blunt bodies, while ignoring the viscous effects. A parallel, finite-volume flow solver is used with unstructured grids on full-scale ship models for the CFD calculations. Both steady-state and time-accurate results are presented for a wind speed of 15.43 m/s (30 knot) and for six different wind-over-deck angles.
