article,doi:10.1177/104538902761696814,"In this paper we discuss the sound absorption property of arrays of micro-acoustic actuators at a control surface. We use the wave equation over the half plane for the velocity potential with a boundary dissipation by a proportional pressure feedback law along the half plane boundary. The feedback gain over the array is described by a distributed shape function. We develop a computational method based on the Fourier transform and employ it for analyzing and evaluating the decay rate of acoustic energy. Specifically, we carry out computations for a diffusive random initial field and report on our resulting numerical findings.",H. T. Banks and D. G. Cole and K. M. Furati and K. Ito and G. A.

article,doi:10.1258/002367798780600070,"As part of a recent animal facility refurbishment, a cubicle containment system was designed to increase the amount of experimental space and also provide containment facilities to support the holding and use of specialized animal models. In order to achieve this, a series of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) studies was undertaken to evaluate the effects of different airflows and in order to optimize ventilation, a variety of exhaust/supply arrangements and animal loads was employed. These studies showed that air delivered via two, opposed, low level ducts, at a rate of 20 air changes per hour and exhausted high in the cubicle above the rack, was the optimal configuration resulting in minimal turbulence, stagnation and entrainment.",G.

article,doi:10.1177/0954410011417541,"The application of a previously developed computational method to the prediction of high-lift performance for multi-element aerofoil sections operating at transonic flow conditions is described. The flows are computed by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, using a full differential Reynolds-stress turbulence model to evaluate the various Reynolds-stress components appearing in the governing mean-flow equations. Algebraic wall functions are used to bridge the molecular viscosity-dominated region immediately adjacent to the aerofoil surfaces. An unstructured grid-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology is used to deal with the geometric complexity of the multi-element aerofoil configurations. Initial results are presented for the viscous, transonic flow development around the SKF 1.1 supercritical aerofoil section, equipped with either a trailing-edge flap or a leading-edge slat. Predicted surface pressure distributions generally compare well with experimental data for the two high-lift aerofoil geometries considered, at a free-stream Mach number of 0.6 and over a range of incidence angles. There are some discrepancies in the regions immediately downstream of shock wave/boundary layer interactions, possibly resulting from the use of wall-function boundary conditions in the computations. Predicted Mach number contours indicate the complexity of the transonic flow fields for high-lift configurations, with the slat wake passing through an extensive supersonic-flow region, terminated by a normal shock wave, on the main aerofoil upper surface, for example.",LJ Johnston,10.1177/0954410011417541,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0954410011417541,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering",,8,912–929,"Computational fluid dynamics analysis of multi-element, high-lift aerofoil sections at transonic manoeuvre conditions",https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0954410011417541,226,2012c
article,doi:10.1177/15554120231211376,"This article analyzes the configuration of fear generated by the computational monster in computer games. We view the monster as a computational entity, which we approach through our theory of game-play coupled with the concepts of loss aversion and endowment effect. Of particular interest is player perception of the threat posed by monsters as they perturb the experience of progression and the sensation of control within the game. We scrutinize this aspect from a situational as well as an existential perspective. Furthermore, we advance an analytical scheme of the threat of the computational monster, which is radically different from the traditional academic approach with its emphasis on the representation of monsters. Overall, we argue that the threat players perceive when facing monsters in computer games springs more from the computational nature of monsters—how they upset progression and the feeling of control—and less from the representation of the monster(s).",Lasse Juel Larsen and Bo Kampmann Walther,10.1177/15554120231211376,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/15554120231211376,Games and Culture,,0,15554120231211376,Fear of Monsters: Toward an Understanding of the Threat of the Computational Monster Read Through the Theoretical Lens  of Game-Play,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/15554120231211376,0,2023d
article,doi:10.1177/0735633119887508,"This study implemented a data-driven approach to identify Chinese high school students’ common errors in a Java-based introductory programming course using the data in an automated assessment tool called the Mulberry. Students’ error-related behaviors were also analyzed, and their relationships to success in introductory programming were investigated. This study identified 15 common compilation errors and 6 common test errors. The results showed that these common errors accounted for a large proportion of all errors, so identifying the common errors is important to help students succeed in introductory programming courses. Based on these common errors, five underlying student difficulties were identified and are discussed. In addition, after analyzing existing measures of students’ error-related behaviors, we developed a measure called improvement rate to quantify students’ success in fixing errors. The results of our study suggest that students’ competence of improving code is important to their success in introductory programming. We recommend researchers design and develop automated assessment tools that provide feedback messages for common student errors and instructors who explicitly teach knowledge and skills of improving code in class.",Yizhou Qian and James Lehman,10.1177/0735633119887508,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0735633119887508,Journal of Educational Computing Research,,5,919–945,An Investigation of High School Students’ Errors in Introductory Programming: A Data-Driven Approach,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0735633119887508,58,2020e
article,doi:10.1177/1687814015606307,"Any hydraulic reaction turbine is installed with a draft tube that impacts widely the entire turbine performance, on which its functions are as follows: drive the flux in appropriate manner after it releases its energy to the runner; recover the suction head by a suction effect; and improve the dynamic energy in the runner outlet. All these functions are strongly linked to the geometric definition of the draft tube. This article proposes a geometric parametrization and analysis of a Francis turbine draft tube. Based on the parametric definition, geometric changes in the draft tube are proposed and the turbine performance is modeled by computational fluid dynamics; the boundary conditions are set by measurements performed in a hydroelectric power plant. This modeling allows us to see the influence of the draft tube shape on the entire turbine performance. The numerical analysis is based on the steady-state solution of the turbine component flows for different guide vanes opening and multiple modified draft tubes. The computational fluid dynamics predictions are validated using hydroelectric plant measurements. The prediction of the turbine performance is successful and it is linked to the draft tube geometric features; therefore, it is possible to obtain a draft tube parameter value that results in a desired turbine performance.",JB Sosa and G Urquiza and JC García and LL Castro,10.1177/1687814015606307,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1687814015606307,Advances in Mechanical Engineering,,10,1687814015606307,Computational fluid dynamics simulation and geometric design of hydraulic turbine draft tube,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1687814015606307,7,2015f
article,doi:10.1179/037195504225004706,"Most manganese used in the world is consumed as ferroalloys by the steelmaking industry. Submerged arc electric furnace smelting using the manganese-rich slag method is widely used to produce ferromanganese. This process has been modelled using the HSC computational thermodynamics package. It was assumed that higher manganese and iron oxides are reduced to MnO and FeO before entering the zone where molten slag and alloy form and equilibrate. The model predictions were compared to data from Thermit Alloys (P) Limited, an Indian ferroalloy smelter, and the agreement was found to be good. It was then used to examine the affects of changing the amount of carbon reductant and temperature on several performance indicators. The results of this modelling are discussed and it is concluded that the model is useful as an aid to understanding ferromanganese smelting.",E. C. Vanderstaay and D. R. Swinbourne and M.

article,doi:10.1177/1420326X17718053,"To design a comfortable aircraft cabin environment, designers conventionally follow an iterative guess-and-correction procedure to determine the air-supply parameters. The conventional method has an extremely low efficiency but does not guarantee an optimal design. This investigation proposed an inverse design method based on a proper orthogonal decomposition of the thermo-flow data provided by full computational fluid dynamics simulations. The orthogonal spatial modes of the thermo-flow fields and corresponding coefficients were firstly extracted. Then, a thermo-flow field was expressed into a linear combination of the spatial modes with their coefficients. The coefficients for each spatial mode are functions of air-supply parameters, which can be interpolated. With a quick map of the cause–effect relationship between the air-supply parameters and the exhibited thermo-flow fields, the optimal air-supply parameters were determined from specific design targets. By setting the percentage of dissatisfied and the predicted mean vote as design targets, the proposed method was implemented for inverse determination of air-supply parameters in two aircraft cabins. The results show that the inverse design using computational fluid dynamics-based proper orthogonal decomposition method is viable. Most of computing time lies in the construction of data samples of thermo-flow fields, while the proper orthogonal decomposition analysis and data interpolation is efficient.",Jihong Wang and Tengfei (Tim) Zhang and Hongbiao Zhou and Shugang Wang,10.1177/1420326X17718053,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1420326X17718053,Indoor and Built Environment,,10,1379–1391,Inverse design of aircraft cabin environment using computational fluid dynamics-based proper orthogonal decomposition method,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1420326X17718053,27,2018h
article,doi:10.1177/0049124115610347,"Model uncertainty is pervasive in social science. A key question is how robust empirical results are to sensible changes in model specification. We present a new approach and applied statistical software for computational multimodel analysis. Our approach proceeds in two steps: First, we estimate the modeling distribution of estimates across all combinations of possible controls as well as specified functional form issues, variable definitions, standard error calculations, and estimation commands. This allows analysts to present their core, preferred estimate in the context of a distribution of plausible estimates. Second, we develop a model influence analysis showing how each model ingredient affects the coefficient of interest. This shows which model assumptions, if any, are critical to obtaining an empirical result. We demonstrate the architecture and interpretation of multimodel analysis using data on the union wage premium, gender dynamics in mortgage lending, and tax flight migration among U.S. states. These illustrate how initial results can be strongly robust to alternative model specifications or remarkably dependent on a knife-edge specification.",Cristobal Young and Katherine Holsteen,10.1177/0049124115610347,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0049124115610347,Sociological Methods & Research,,1,3–40,Model Uncertainty and Robustness: A Computational Framework for Multimodel Analysis,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0049124115610347,46,2017i
article,doi:10.1177/1056789508090748,"The primary objective of this investigation is to develop efficient and robust computational schemes for a damage-coupled cyclic thermoviscoplasticity model for solder materials. Three constitutive integration algorithms, Euler, modified Euler, and semi-implicit algorithm for the model are examined. The three algorithms for the model are coded in the commercial finite element (FE) code ABAQUS (version 6.21) via its user-defined material subroutine UMAT. Two single-step algorithms of the substep scheme are applied for the modified Euler algorithm to control the error in the integration of constitutive laws. A semi-empirical formulation is established for an adaptive time stepping algorithm that is based on the Euler algorithm. The simulations of single-element, miniature specimen and notched specimen simulations have been conducted and compared with the test results under monotonic tensile, creep, and fatigue tests of 63Sn-37Pb solder. It is observed that the explicit algorithm consistently requires much less CPU time than others. The modified Euler algorithm has shown, on the other hand, to be not only efficient but also accurate. The semi-implicit algorithm yields an accurate solution. It is worth noting that the method is also effective by applying an appropriate integration scheme.",A.H. Zhao and C.L.
