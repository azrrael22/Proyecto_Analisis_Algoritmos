article,doi:10.1177/21582440241260612,"Since the first phase of the lockdown in Malaysia, the cinema has been the place which best exemplifies the implementation of the control order in the venue-based sectors. After almost 2 years of physical distancing and lifestyle changes, the authority attempted to bring a new form of “normal life” to its residents. Such a decision witnessed more economic sectors were permitted to reopen, cinema among them. This study employed a mixed-method approach which aims to identify the emerging factors which inform about Malaysian audiences’ perception of cinema-going in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It examines the audiences with the help of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as this theory claims that people are more likely to act in a certain way if they feel certain behaviors will lead to specific results that are in keeping with their values. This study identified the attitude toward cinema reopening and readiness toward visiting cinema are able to significantly predict all the related factors of cinemagoers’ willingness in the post COVID-19 era. The results informed on the concerns of their family members, friends, and those with whom they have regular physical contact have become the agent of decision-making in terms of cinema-going.",Wang Changsong and Low Jinghong and Aleena Tan Poh Ling and Muhammad Afiq Bin Sukiman and Lucyann Kerry,10.1177/21582440241260612,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/21582440241260612,Sage Open,2,21582440241260612,An Understanding of Malaysian Cinemagoers in the Post COVID-19 Era by Using a Computational Ontology,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/21582440241260612,14,2024b
article,doi:10.3102/00346543231216958,"Computer programming provides a framework for interdisciplinary learning in sciences, arts and languages. However, increasing integration of programming in K–12 shows that the block-based and text-based dichotomy of programming environments does not reflect the spectrum of their affordance. Hence, educators are confronted with a fundamental hurdle of matching programming environments with learners’ cognitive abilities and learning objectives. This study addresses this challenge by analyzing 111 articles evaluating the affordances of programming environments to identify both structural and theoretical models to support educators’ choice of programming environments. The following dimensions of programming environments were identified: connectivity mode, interface natural language, language inheritance, age appropriateness, cost of environment, output interface, input interface, and project types. For each of these dimensions, the synthesis of the literature ranged from examining its nature and effect on learning programming to the implications of choosing an environment and the critical gaps that future studies should address. The findings offer instructors useful parameters to compare and assess programming environments’ suitability and alignment with learning objectives.",Ndudi Okechukwu Ezeamuzie and Mercy Noyenim Ezeamuzie,10.3102/00346543231216958,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.3102/00346543231216958,Review of Educational Research,0,00346543231216958,Multidimensional Framing of Environments Beyond Blocks and Texts in K–12 Programming,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.3102/00346543231216958,0,2024c
article,doi:10.1177/0741932519843998,"The purpose of this literature review was to synthesize recent research (2009–2018) for teaching science to students with intellectual disability and intellectual disability/autism. Authors identified a total of 15 studies; of these, 12 were determined to be methodologically sound studies using the Council for Exceptional Children quality indicators. Based on the methodologically sound studies, authors analyzed the evidence base of the instructional practices to teach science content and science practices to students with intellectual disability and intellectual disability/autism. Unlike previous literature reviews in which the focus has been on teaching science content, authors contribute to the literature on teaching science to this population by determining the evidence for teaching the science practices (e.g., asking questions, communicating findings). Resulting analysis was used to offer research-based recommendations for providing quality science instruction to students with intellectual disability and intellectual disability/autism.

article,doi:10.1260/1478-0771.12.1.1,"The use of computational processes in architecture is a widespread practice which draws on a set of theories of computer science developed in the 60s and 70s. With the advent of computers, many of these methodologies were developed in research centres in the USA and the UK. Focussing on this period, this paper investigates the importance of the German Hochschule fur Gestaltung, Ulm (HfG) design school in the early stages of computation in design and architecture. Even though there were no computers in the school, it may be argued that its innovative pedagogy and distinguished faculty members launched analogical computational design methods that can be seen as the basis for further computational approaches in architecture. The paper draws on archive material, as well as at an original interview with Tomas Maldonado, to propose that the remarkable work pursued by Tomas Maldonado (the educational project), Max Bense (information aesthetics) and Horst Rittel (scientific methods) was fundamental in establishing HfG Ulm as the forerunner of computation in architecture.",Isabel Clara Neves and João Rocha and José Pinto Duarte,10.1260/1478-0771.12.1.1,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1260/1478-0771.12.1.1,International Journal of Architectural Computing,1,1–25,"Computational Design Research in Architecture: The Legacy of the Hochschule für Gestaltung, Ulm",https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1260/1478-0771.12.1.1,12,2014e

Collaborative teaching, where faculty members from different disciplines co-teach a course, may be a solution. This report assesses the learning outcomes of an advertising technology course taught by faculty from one university’s advertising, computer science and human-computer interaction programs. The course was run twice, with a third one in progress. Students were predominantly advertising majors, with a minority of computer science and design majors.

article,doi:10.1177/00491241221122616,"This paper considers the adoption of computational techniques within research designs modeled after the extended case method. Echoing calls to augment the power of contemporary researchers through the adoption of computational text analysis methods, we offer a framework for thinking about how such techniques can be integrated into quasi-ethnographic workflows to address broad, structural sociological claims. We focus, in particular, on how this adoption of novel forms of evidence impacts corpus design and interpretation (which we tie to matters of casing), theoretical elaboration (which we associate to moving empirical claims across scales and empirical domains), and verification (which we see as a process of reflexive scaffolding of theoretical claims). We provide an example of the use of this framework through a study of the marketization of social scientific knowledge in the United Kingdom.",Juan Pablo Pardo-Guerra and Prithviraj Pahwa,10.1177/00491241221122616,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/00491241221122616,Sociological Methods & Research,4,1826–1867,The Extended Computational Case Method: A Framework for Research Design,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/00491241221122616,51,2022g
article,doi:10.1177/21582440221097916,"For 2 weeks in the summer of 2018, K-12 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teachers (n = 40) attended a professional development (PD) that included four sessions focused on computer science modeling with follow-up academic year sessions; however, overall, the teachers did not incorporate or utilize modeling means or how as the instructors intended. The purpose of the study is to examine why this occurred, and the authors looked at the teachers’ modeling discourse. Using two theories to connect to practice (terministic screens, and schema theory), the authors collected data via the surveys, interviews, and email reflections. The authors analyzed the results via coding to explore participants’ concept of models and the potential difficulties of implementing computer modeling in their classrooms. Findings show that the term model was interpreted differently by the PD’s faculty team and participants. Further, the authors found that the majority of presenters held differing theories of models than the participants. Participant concepts of models did improve slightly after the PD, but lingering model concepts caused confusion with the anticipated PD results. Conclusions include five general modeling concepts which are presented and explained. Implications are provided showcasing articulated keys for delivering PD that assists in eliminating discursive and theoretical issues. Included are considerations for STEM teacher educators, PD providers, and K-12 teachers. The main study limitations include mixed K-12 teaching participants, distance between participants, a self-selected population, and non-generalizable findings based on qualitative work.

article,doi:10.1177/07356331211053383,"Scratch, a kind of visual programming software, has been widely used in instruction for primary school children. Scratch constructs a digital world for children to design, develop, and create coursework in which their creative thinking is fostered. Different instructional methods have been designed and implemented to stimulate children’s creative thinking skills through their coursework. This study investigated whether scaffolding construction with mind mapping promoted children’s creative thinking in a Scratch course. Two groups of 84 fifth-grade pupils participated in the study. The experimental group of 44 students adopted the scaffolding construction with mind mapping in the Scratch course, while the control group of 40 students did not use the mind mapping method. The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking-Figural (TTCT-F) and Torrance Creative Personality Self-Report Scale were used three times over the 16-week learning period. The results show that learning in the Scratch course promoted the children’s creative thinking. The difference between the two groups indicates that mind mapping was beneficial to improve the children’s creative thinking.",Yu-Sheng Su and Mingming Shao and Li Zhao,10.1177/07356331211053383,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/07356331211053383,Journal of Educational Computing Research,4,906–929,Effect of Mind Mapping on Creative Thinking of Children in Scratch Visual Programming Education,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/07356331211053383,60,2022i
article,doi:10.1177/0735633121997360,"Although the current landscape in education emphasizes the importance of developing students’ information literacy in formal education settings, little attention has been paid to information literacy within the context of social media use. This study investigated the relationship between information literacy and social media competence (SMC) among 1843 university students. This was done in order to increase knowledge of the components that may be important for preparing university students to be information literate citizens in social media environments. Students’ information literacy and SMC were measured by the Student Information Literacy Test and the SMC-CS scale respectively. Correlation and regression analyses were utilized to explore the relationship between university students’ information literacy and their SMC. The results showed that university students’ ability to utilize information technology to solve problems, and their sense of responsible behavior in cyberspace, are the most critical factors in predicting students’ SMC. Based on the findings, theoretical and practical implications are discussed in terms of enhancing university students’ information literacy and SMC.",Sha Zhu and Harrison Hao Yang and Di Wu and Feixiong Chen,10.1177/0735633121997360,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0735633121997360,Journal of Educational Computing Research,7,1425–1449,Investigating the Relationship Between Information Literacy and Social Media Competence Among University Students,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0735633121997360,59,2021j
