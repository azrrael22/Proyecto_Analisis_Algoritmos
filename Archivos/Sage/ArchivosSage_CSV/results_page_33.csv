article,doi:10.1177/20563051231196880,"Social media, in general, and Facebook in particular, have been clearly identified as important platforms for the dissemination of mis- and disinformation and related problematic content. However, the patterns and processes of such dissemination are still not sufficiently understood. We detail a novel computational methodology that focusses on the identification of high-profile vectors of ‚Äúfake news‚Äù and other problematic information in public Facebook spaces. The method enables examination of networks of content sharing that emerge between public pages and groups, and external sources, and the study of longitudinal dynamics of these networks as interests and allegiances shift and new developments (such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the US presidential elections) drive the emergence or decline of dominant themes. Through a case study of content captured between 2016 and 2021, we demonstrate how this methodology allows the development of a new and more comprehensive picture of the overall impact of ‚Äúfake news,‚Äù in all its forms, on contemporary societies.",Daniel Angus and Axel Bruns and Edward Hurcombe and Stephen Harrington and Xue Ying (Jane) Tan,10.1177/20563051231196880,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/20563051231196880,Social Media + Society,,3,20563051231196880,Computational Communication Methods for Examining Problematic News-Sharing Practices on Facebook at Scale,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/20563051231196880,9,2023a
article,doi:10.1177/0894439320914505,"Anxiety is a pervasive emotional state that tends to arise in situations involving uncertainty due partly to social and contextual issues including competition, economic disparity, and social insecurity. Thus, distribution of aggregate emotions, such as in anxiety, may reveal an important picture of otherwise invisible social processes in which individuals interact with local and global opportunities, constraints, and potential threats. The aim of this study is to present a computational approach to the dynamic distribution of anxiety extracted from natural language expressions of users of Twitter, a popular global social media platform. We develop an unsupervised machine learning procedure based on a naive Bayes model to classify contents of anxiety, estimate the degree of anxiety, and construct a geographic map of spatiotemporal distribution of anxiety. To validate our mapping results, a multilevel statistical analysis was performed to examine how anxiety distribution is correlated with other district-level sociodemographic statistics such as rates of birth and early divorce. Implications for further research and extension are discussed.",Yong Suk Choi and Hansung Kim and Dongyoung Sohn,10.1177/0894439320914505,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0894439320914505,Social Science Computer Review,,3,598‚Äì617,Mapping Social Distress: A Computational Approach to Spatiotemporal Distribution of Anxiety,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0894439320914505,40,2022b
article,doi:10.1177/1046878117748175,"Background. Educational games are nowadays used for facilitating the teaching and learning process of various subjects. History is one of the subjects that simulations and games are used for promoting active learning and supporting students in comprehending various history-related subjects. Aim. This article reports on a new educational game on Greek mythology, called MYTH TROUBLES, designed and developed from scratch with the aim of supporting primary school students in studying Greek mythology and raising their interest on the subject of history. Method. The article presents the educational rationale and design of MYTH TROUBLES in the context of an educational games design model proposed in the literature. Since the game was implemented with the platform of Scratch and it is available online both for students (or anyone interested in Greek Mythology) and game developers, some information for its implementation is also provided. The results of a pilot evaluation of MYTH TROUBLES with the help of 21 experienced school teachers are presented, along with proposals for improvement and extension of the game. Results. Teachers evaluated positively MYTH TROUBLES in terms of acceptability, usability, utility as an educational tool, as well as its interface and game play and expressed their willingness to use it in the classroom. Conclusions. MYTH TROUBLES is considered appropriate by teachers for supporting the teaching and learning of Greek mythology and assessing its educational value in class is the next step. Scratch is appropriate for implementing such educational games and sharing them with interested players and game developers.",Olympia Evangelopoulou and Stelios Xinogalos,10.1177/1046878117748175,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1046878117748175,Simulation & Gaming,,1,71‚Äì91,MYTH TROUBLES: An Open-Source Educational Game in Scratch for Greek Mythology,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1046878117748175,49,2018c

article,doi:10.1177/1478077116638924,"In the current computer-aided architectural design education, students do not necessarily need to be taught to use more digital tools, but need to be introduced to the possibilities of designing their own digital tools. Designing the original tools with the assistance of educational-use environment for computational fluid dynamics programming improves the capability of the students to estimate the flows around architectures based on the mathematical background and the actual program. The authors have developed Educational Library for Fluid as an educational-use environment for computational fluid dynamics programming and ran the workshop where the students majoring in computer-aided architectural design tried to design computational fluid dynamics tools with Educational Library for Fluid. In this article, the details of Educational Library for Fluid and the results of the workshop are being reported.

article,doi:10.1177/02632764211048548,What is algorithmic thought? It is not possible to address this question without first reflecting on how the Universal Turing Machine transformed symbolic logic and brought to a halt the universality of mathematical formalism and the biocentric speciation of thought. The article draws on Sylvia Wynter‚Äôs discussion of the sociogenic principle to argue that both neurocognitive and formal models of automated cognition constitute the epistemological explanations of the origin of the human and of human sapience. Wynter‚Äôs argument will be related to Gilbert Simondon‚Äôs reflections on ‚Äòtechnical mentality‚Äô to consider how socio-techno-genic assemblages can challenge the biocentricism and the formalism of modern epistemology. This article turns to ludic logic as one possible example of techno-semiotic languages as a speculative overturning of sociogenic programming. Algorithmic rules become technique-signs coinciding not with classic formalism but with interactive localities without re-originating the universality of colonial and patriarchal cosmogony.,Luciana Parisi,10.1177/02632764211048548,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/02632764211048548,"Theory, Culture & Society",,7‚Äì8,33‚Äì53,Interactive Computation and Artificial Epistemologies,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/02632764211048548,38,2021f

article,doi:10.1177/00491241221122596,"This article presents a computational approach to examining immigrant incorporation through shifts in the social ‚Äúmainstream.‚Äù Analyzing a historical corpus of American etiquette books, texts from 1922‚Äì2017 describing social norms, we identify mainstream shifts related to long-standing groups which once were and may currently still be seen as immigrant outsiders in the United States: Catholic, Chinese, Irish, Italian, Jewish, Mexican, and Muslim groups. The analysis takes a computational grounded theory approach, combining qualitative readings and computational text analyses. Using word embeddings, we operationalize the chosen groups as focal group concepts. We extract sections of text that are salient to the focal group concepts to create group-specific text corpora. Two computational approaches make it possible to examine mainstream shifts in these corpora. First, we use sentiment analysis to observe the positive sentiment in each corpus and its change over time. Second, we observe changes in each corpus‚Äôs position on a semantic dimension represented by the poles of ‚Äústrange‚Äù and ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù The results indicate mainstream shifts through increases in positive sentiment and movement from strange to normal over time for most of the group-specific corpora.

article,doi:10.1177/026119290903700509,"For over a decade, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has been engaged in the applied research, development, and evaluation of computational toxicology methods used to support the safety evaluation of a diverse set of regulated products. The basis for evaluating computational toxicology methods is multi-factorial, including the potential for increased efficiency, reduction in the numbers of animals used, lower costs, and the need to explore emerging technologies that support the goals of the US FDA‚Äôs Critical Path Initiative (e.g. to make decision support information available early in the drug review process). The US FDA‚Äôs efforts have been facilitated by agency-approved data-sharing agreements between government and commercial software developers. This commentary review describes former and current scientific initiatives at the agency, in the area of computational toxicology methods. In particular, toxicology-based QSAR models, ToxML databases and knowledgebases will be addressed. Notably, many of the computational toxicology tools available are commercial products ‚Äî however, several are emerging as non-commercial products, which are freely-available to the public, and which will facilitate the understanding of how these programs work and avoid the ‚Äúblack box‚Äù paradigm. Through productive collaborations, the US FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, and the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, have worked together to evaluate, develop and apply these methods to chemical toxicity endpoints of regulatory interest.",Chihae Yang and Luis G.

article,doi:10.1177/0959354317722867,"Two options fuel the debate on the cognitive processes underlying the perception of affordances. On the one hand, the ecological theory of affordance fits with the methodological assumptions of the dynamical systems theory of cognition. On the other hand, it is nowadays common to conceive the perception of affordances within a computational framework. This article defends the explanatory power of a computational approach and aims to extend the concept of affordance beyond the boundaries of the dynamical systems theory of cognition. For that purpose, I consider the case of patients suffering from optic ataxia, a condition in which some aspects of visual guidance over reaching with the hand are lost following a lesion in the left parietal cortex. Etiological considerations, indeed, reveal that a computational approach to the perception of affordances allows for an explanation of ataxic behavior that is not available to the dynamical systems theory.",Silvano Zipoli Caiani,10.1177/0959354317722867,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0959354317722867,Theory & Psychology,,5,663‚Äì682,When the affordances disappear: Dynamical and computational explanations of optic ataxia,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0959354317722867,27,2017j
