article,doi:10.1177/2053951715622512,"This article considers the issue of opacity as a problem for socially consequential mechanisms of classification and ranking, such as spam filters, credit card fraud detection, search engines, news trends, market segmentation and advertising, insurance or loan qualification, and credit scoring. These mechanisms of classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms, and in many cases on machine learning algorithms to do this work. In this article, I draw a distinction between three forms of opacity: (1) opacity as intentional corporate or state secrecy, (2) opacity as technical illiteracy, and (3) an opacity that arises from the characteristics of machine learning algorithms and the scale required to apply them usefully. The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves. I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight code audit. I argue that recognizing the distinct forms of opacity that may be coming into play in a given application is a key to determining which of a variety of technical and non-technical solutions could help to prevent harm.",Jenna Burrell,10.1177/2053951715622512,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/2053951715622512,Big Data & Society,,1,2053951715622512,How the machine ‘thinks’: Understanding opacity in machine learning algorithms,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/2053951715622512,3,2016a
article,doi:10.1177/20539517221080146,"The size and variation in both meaning-making and populations that characterize much contemporary text data demand research processes that support both discovery, interpretation and measurement. We assess one dominant strategy within the social sciences that takes a computer-led approach to text analysis. The approach is coined computational grounded theory. This strategy, we argue, relies on a set of unwarranted assumptions, namely, that unsupervised models return natural clusters of meaning, that the researcher can understand text with limited immersion and that indirect validation is sufficient for ensuring unbiased and precise measurement. In response to this criticism, we develop a framework that is computer assisted. We argue that our reformulation of computational grounded theory better aligns with the principles within grounded theory, anthropological theory generation and ethnography.",Hjalmar Bang Carlsen and Snorre Ralund,10.1177/20539517221080146,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/20539517221080146,Big Data & Society,,1,20539517221080144,Computational grounded theory revisited: From computer-led to computer-assisted text analysis,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/20539517221080146,9,2022b
article,doi:10.1177/1069397110393894,"Mel Ember was co-Principal Investigator in the Mason-HRAF Joint Project on Eastern Africa, a multiyear project aimed at developing and analyzing advanced computational agent-based models of human societies across 10 countries and 12 ecosystems. A major unsolved challenge in this kind of social science research is to devise a systematic way to compare, contrast, and communicate different models of social dynamics along relevant dimensions and characteristics, given the inherent complexity of most computational agent-based models. This article proposes a viable systematic framework for comparing models and illustrates its application using some of the models that Mel helped inspire and develop as senior project participant.",Claudio Cioffi-Revilla,10.1177/1069397110393894,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1069397110393894,Cross-Cultural Research,,2,208–230,Comparing Agent-Based Computational Simulation Models in Cross-Cultural Research,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1069397110393894,45,2011c
article,doi:10.1177/20570473241284759,"This article proposes and tests a reproducible framework for a computational method to measure social media-based deliberative discourse by analyzing commentary surrounding the Canadian convoy protests of COVID-19 vaccine mandates and restrictions. Employing a combination of analytic calculations, alongside tools such as Google Perspective and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), this article assesses the quality of online deliberative discourse using established measures of deliberation including the variables rationality, interactivity, equality, and civility. We propose computational approaches to measuring these variables, and work toward validating our approach by observing correlations between an established computational measure of online deliberation-cognitive complexity. This computational approach is tested using Twitter and Reddit commentary related to the convoy protests that took place in Ottawa, Canada, during February 2022, which influenced the emergence of similar protests around the world. In addition to testing our proposed online deliberative discourse measurement framework, this case study provides insight into the deliberative characteristics of the Twitter and Reddit social media platforms.",Stuart Duncan and Lauren Dwyer and Hanako Smith and Davis Vallesi and Frauke Zeller and Charles Davis,10.1177/20570473241284759,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/20570473241284759,Communication and the Public,,0,20570473241284760,Toward a computational mixed methods framework to measure online deliberative discourse,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/20570473241284759,0,2024d

article,doi:10.1177/14782103231183485,"The Computer Science (CS) for All national movement is increasingly relying on state-level change to broaden participation in computing. To foster an environment in which all students have opportunities to thrive in CS education, policy action is necessary to help create the learning conditions for success. CS education in California has grown substantially in the last decade, yet opportunity gaps remain for young women and Black, Latinx, and Native American students. Early grassroots efforts to advance equity in computing evolved into the Computer Science for California coalition of K–16 educators, industry leaders, and other equity advocates to promote the growth of equity-minded teaching and learning opportunities in K–12 CS education. New policies at the state level reflect an increasing commitment among Sacramento policymakers to expand CS education. Yet troubling disparities in CS access and success continue to exist between traditionally advantaged students and their historically underserved peers. By drawing on interviews with 20 individuals involved in CS education policy, this study illuminates the contributing factors to recent policy successes and considerations for achieving further progress. Interviewees described the importance of tapping into the values of influential decision makers, educating policymakers about the benefits of CS education, and identifying the problems and solutions that require policy attention. To build the capacity of key policy actors in making informed decisions, this research demonstrates the continued value of providing useful information, developing relationships with policymakers, and creating resources that are easy to consume and understand. The interviews also suggest that attention to funding, disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, equity, and ongoing stakeholder support will shape prospects for CS education policy success moving forward.",Julie Flapan and Joel Knudson and Candice Handjojo and Ashley Sunde and Roxana Hadad,10.1177/14782103231183485,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/14782103231183485,Policy Futures in Education,,0,14782103231183484,Power surge: How a multistakeholder coalition promotes equity in computer science education policy,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/14782103231183485,0,2023f
article,doi:10.1177/1077546318788405,"The complex nature of the tire/road noise generation process makes it difficult to isolate and study each mechanism individually. This paper presents an experimental and numerical investigation of air-borne tire noise generation mechanisms for a realistic tire. Experimentally, a single slot is cut into the tire and the noise data are measured and studied. Air-borne noise is isolated by filling the slot with foam and comparing the resulting frequency spectra. Numerically, a previously developed computational fluid dynamics tire noise prediction model is employed to predict the air-borne noise for the same tire, under similar operating conditions. A direct comparison between the experimental and computational results is also presented in terms of pressure time traces and spectral characteristics. Comparisons indicate that the computational model is capable of predicting the noise generated by the air pockets in the tire. While providing a deeper understanding of the causes of air-borne noise, this paper also aims to demonstrate the use of a computational tool that can be used to obtain a reasonably accurate prediction of air-borne tire noise.",Prashanta Gautam and Yousof Azizi and Abhilash J.

article,doi:10.1177/1059712312445902,"Recent neuroscientific evidence in human and non-human primates indicates that the regions that become active during motor execution and motor observation overlap extensively in the cerebral cortex. This suggests that to observe an action, these primates employ their motor and somatosensation areas in order to simulate it internally. In line with this finding, in the current paper, we examine relevant neuroscientific evidence in order to design a computational agent that can facilitate observational learning of reaching movements. For this reason, we develop a novel motor control system, inspired from contemporary theories of motor control, and demonstrate how it can be used during observation to facilitate learning, without the active involvement of the agent’s body. Our results show that novel motor skills can be acquired only by observation, by optimizing the peripheral components of the agent’s motion.",Emmanouil Hourdakis and Panos Trahanias,10.1177/1059712312445902,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1059712312445902,Adaptive Behavior,,4,237–256,Computational modeling of observational learning inspired by the cortical underpinnings of human primates,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1059712312445902,20,2012h
article,doi:10.1177/0731948719865499,"The purpose of the study was to compare the deficit profiles of two important types of mathematics difficulties. Three cognitive measures (working memory, processing speed, and reasoning), two mathematics measures (numerical facts retrieval and mathematics vocabulary), and reading comprehension were assessed among 237 Chinese fourth-grade students, among whom 28 were classified as students with only computational difficulties (CD), 34 were classified as having only word problem-solving difficulties (WPD), 20 were classified as students with computational and word problem-solving difficulties (CD + WPD), and 43 typically developing (TD) peers. Multivariate analysis showed that, compared with TD, CD was associated with weakness in numerical working memory; WPD was associated with weakness in reading comprehension; both CD and WPD were associated with weakness in mathematics vocabulary. However, CD and WPD did not differ from each other on any of those profiling measures. Implications for understanding mathematics competence and identification of mathematics difficulties are discussed.",Xin Lin and Peng Peng and Hongjing Luo,10.1177/0731948719865499,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0731948719865499,Learning Disability Quarterly,,2,110–122,The Deficit Profile of Elementary Students With Computational Difficulties Versus Word Problem-Solving Difficulties,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0731948719865499,44,2021i
article,doi:10.4137/BBI.S16803,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are at the core of post-transcriptional regulation and thus of gene expression control at the RNA level. One of the principal challenges in the field of gene expression regulation is to understand RBPs mechanism of action. As a result of recent evolution of experimental techniques, it is now possible to obtain the RNA regions recognized by RBPs on a transcriptome-wide scale. In fact, CLIP-seq protocols use the joint action of CLIP, crosslinking immunoprecipitation, and high-throughput sequencing to recover the transcriptome-wide set of interaction regions for a particular protein. Nevertheless, computational methods are necessary to process CLIP-seq experimental data and are a key to advancement in the understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms. Considering the importance of computational methods in this area, we present a review of the current status of computational approaches used and proposed for CLIP-seq data.",Paula H.
