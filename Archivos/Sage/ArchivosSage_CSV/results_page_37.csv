article,doi:10.1177/00222429231221698,"McShane et al.’s (2024) wide-ranging critique of null hypothesis significance testing provides a number of specific suggestions for improved practice in empirical research. This commentary amplifies several of these from the perspective of computational statistics—particularly nonparametrics, resampling/bootstrapping, and Bayesian methods—applied to common research problems. Throughout, the author emphasizes estimation (as opposed to testing) and uncertainty quantification through a comprehensive process of “curating” a variety of graphical and tabular evidence. Specifically, researchers should be encouraged to estimate the quantities that matter, with as few assumptions as possible, in multiple ways, then try to visualize it all, documenting their pathway from data to results for others to follow.",Fred Feinberg,10.1177/00222429231221698,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/00222429231221698,Journal of Marketing,,3,20–28,p-Values as QWERTY: Curating Evidence in the Computational Era,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/00222429231221698,88,2024a
article,doi:10.1243/09544062JMES2464,"A robust approach to computational kinematics intended to cope with algorithmic singularities is introduced in this article. The approach is based on the reduction of the original system of equations to a subsystem of bivariate equations, as opposed to the multivariate polynomial reduction leading to the characteristic univariate polynomial. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated for the exact function-generation synthesis of planar, spherical, and spatial four-bar linkages. Some numerical examples are provided for the case of the spherical four-bar function generator with six precision points to show the benefits of the proposed method with respect to methods reported in the literature.",L Gracia and J Angeles,10.1243/09544062JMES2464,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1243/09544062JMES2464,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science",,4,987–999,Robustness to algorithmic singularities and sensitivity in computational kinematics,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1243/09544062JMES2464,225,2011b
article,doi:10.1177/0261927X20969752,"Politics is an area that is traditionally believed to be gender divided. According to intergroup communication theory, this gender-salient context might cause differences in political communications between genders. Moreover, the internet and social media, which creates a computer-mediated interactive context, might also impact the traditional gender discrepancies in political discourse. This study used Twitter trace-data and computational text analysis to examine such suppositions. By analyzing over one million tweets, we found that compared to men, women generally had a stronger sense of group awareness and cohesion and showed a desire to promote their tweets while avoiding addressing other users in political discussions. Women also focused on family- and home-related issues more than men did. These findings suggest that Twitter is not an ideal public sphere where differences and inequalities are eliminated, but it might be a counter-public sphere that promotes the voices and increases the publicity of marginalized groups.",Lingshu Hu and Michael Wayne Kearney,10.1177/0261927X20969752,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0261927X20969752,Journal of Language and Social Psychology,,4,482–503,Gendered Tweets: Computational Text Analysis of Gender Differences in Political Discussion on Twitter,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0261927X20969752,40,2021c
article,doi:10.1177/1468087417701280,"Mixing and combustion of engine combustion network Spray A after end of injection are modeled using highly resolved multidimensional numerical simulations to explore the physics underlying recent experimental observations of combustion recession. Reacting spray simulations are performed using a traditional Lagrangian–Eulerian coupled formulation for two-phase mixture transport with a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes approach using the open-source computational fluid dynamics code OpenFOAM. Chemical kinetics models for n-dodecane by Cai et al. and Yao et al. are deployed to evaluate the impact of mechanism formulation and low-temperature chemistry on predictions of combustion recession behavior. Simulations with the Cai mechanism show that under standard Spray A conditions, the end-of-injection transient induces second-stage ignition in distinct regions near the nozzle that are initially spatially separated from the lifted diffusion flame, but then rapidly merge with flame. By contrast, the Yao mechanism fails to predict sufficient low-temperature chemistry in mixtures upstream of the diffusion flame during the end-of-injection transient and does not predict combustion recession for the same conditions. The effects of the shape and duration of the end-of-injection transient on the entrainment wave near the nozzle, the likelihood of combustion recession, and the spatiotemporal development of mixing and chemistry in near-nozzle mixtures are also investigated. With a more rapid ramp-down injection profile (ramp-down duration < 400 µs), a weaker combustion recession occurs earlier in time after the start of ramp-down. For extremely fast ramp-down (ramp-down duration = 0), the entrainment flux varies rapidly near the nozzle and over-leaning of the mixture completely suppresses combustion recession. For a slower ramp-down profile with respect to the standard Spray A condition, complete combustion recession back toward the nozzle is observed and combustion recession occurred later in time. Simulations qualitatively agreed with the past experimental and modeling observations of combustion recession with different end-of-injection transients.",Dorrin Jarrahbashi and Sayop Kim and Benjamin W Knox and Caroline L Genzale,10.1177/1468087417701280,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1468087417701280,International Journal of Engine Research,,10,1088–1110,Computational analysis of end-of-injection transients and combustion recession,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1468087417701280,18,2017d
article,doi:10.1177/1350650112466769,"Interfacial phenomena between the wafer and the polishing pad during chemical mechanical polishing are an area of great interest as they affect post-chemical mechanical polishing wafer topographies. Traditionally, the Reynolds equation has been used to predict the fluid pressure between the wafer and the polishing pad. However, with computational fluid dynamics it is possible to predict the fluid pressure and obtain insight into the fluid motion at the leading edge and trailing edge of the wafer. Additionally, computational fluid dynamics allows for the added ability to increase the resolution of the fluid physics to the asperity scale. In this study, a model is developed to predict phenomena related to mixed lubrication chemical mechanical polishing using computational fluid dynamics. Contact mechanics between the wafer and the pad are resolved through a Winkler elastic foundation formulation. The wafer is mounted on a ball joint which allows free rotation to occur. Friction between the wafer and the polishing pad causes the wafer to assume a position which produces a sub-ambient pressure distribution similar to that obtained from experiments. The effects of different table speeds on the interfacial fluid pressure, as predicted by the computational fluid dynamics are presented.",Jeremiah N Mpagazehe and C Fred Higgs,10.1177/1350650112466769,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1350650112466769,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part J: Journal of Engineering Tribology",,7,777–786,A three-dimensional transient model to predict interfacial phenomena during chemical mechanical polishing using computational fluid dynamics,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1350650112466769,227,2013e
article,doi:10.1177/21677026211022013,"Suicide, a leading cause of death, is a complex and a hard-to-predict human tragedy. In this article, we introduce a comprehensive outlook on the emerging movement to integrate computational linguistics (CL) in suicide prevention research and practice. Focusing mainly on the state-of-the-art deep neural network models, in this “travel guide” article, we describe, in a relatively plain language, how CL methodologies could facilitate early detection of suicide risk. Major potential contributions of CL methodologies (e.g., word embeddings, interpretational frameworks) for deepening that theoretical understanding of suicide behaviors and promoting the personalized approach in psychological assessment are presented as well. We also discuss principal ethical and methodological obstacles in CL suicide prevention, such as the difficulty to maintain people’s privacy/safety or interpret the “black box” of prediction algorithms. Ethical guidelines and practical methodological recommendations addressing these obstacles are provided for future researchers and clinicians.",Yaakov Ophir and Refael Tikochinski and Anat Brunstein Klomek and Roi Reichart,10.1177/21677026211022013,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/21677026211022013,Clinical Psychological Science,,2,212–235,The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Computational Linguistics in Suicide Prevention,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/21677026211022013,10,2022f
article,doi:10.1177/1754073909103589,"Based on the belief that computational modeling (thinking in terms of representation and computations) can help to clarify controversial issues in emotion theory, this article examines emotional experience from the perspective of the Computational Belief–Desire Theory of Emotion (CBDTE), a computational explication of the belief–desire theory of emotion. It is argued that CBDTE provides plausible answers to central explanatory challenges posed by emotional experience, including: the phenomenal quality, intensity and object-directedness of emotional experience, the function of emotional experience and its relation to cognition and motivation, and the relation between emotional experience and emotion. In addition, CBDTE avoids most objections that have been raised against cognitive theories of emotion. A remaining objection, that beliefs are not necessary for the emotions covered by CBDTE, is rejected as empirically unsupported.",Rainer Reisenzein,10.1177/1754073909103589,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1754073909103589,Emotion Review,,3,214–222,Emotional Experience in the Computational Belief–Desire Theory of Emotion,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1754073909103589,1,2009g
article,doi:10.3233/JHS-130457,"Over the past decade, the ever-increasing energy demands of IT infrastructures have posed significant challenges for the research community in terms of reducing their total power consumption and minimizing their environmental impact. Optical communication networks are envisioned to be promising candidates to help preventing this problem affecting the Internet backbone, as well as for distributed applications such as computational grids. In this paper, we propose an adaptive and distributed scheme for the establishment of energy-efficient lightpaths in computational grids. The grid is deployed over an optical circuit-switched backbone network, defining an optical grid network. Each node of the backbone network maintains two different dynamic thresholds values and estimates the changes in network performance by evaluating the moving average of the total wavelength channel occupancy on all its input/output links. The nodes have the ability of reducing the energy consumption by entering into an Energy Saving Mode (ESM) on the basis of a comparison between their channel occupancy and the thresholds. Furthermore, we extend our framework by allowing the thresholds to be dynamically adapted depending on the network performance in terms of blocking probability. We show that the proposed method achieves considerable energy savings when compared to a normal energy-unaware operational mode and still allows to maintain an acceptable level of network performance in terms of blocking probability and end-to-end delay. Numerical results are obtained with a Java event-driven simulator of two different optical network topologies.",Daniele Tafani and Burak Kantarci and Hussein T. Mouftah and Conor McArdle and Liam P.

article,doi:10.1177/0036850419901235,"Hydrodynamic effects of mussel farms have attracted increased research attentions in recent years. The understanding of the hydrodynamic impacts is essential for predicting the sustainability of mussel farms. A large mussel farm includes thousands of mussel droppers, and the combined drag on the mussel droppers is sufficient to possibly affect the longevity of the entire long-lines. This article intends to study the drag and wake of an individual long-line mussel dropper using computational fluid dynamics approaches. Two equivalent rough cylinders, namely, Curved-Model and Sharp-Model, have been utilized to simulate the mussel dropper, and each rough cylinder is assigned with surface roughness. The porosity is not considered in this article due to its complexity from inhalant and exhalant of mussels. Two-dimensional laminar simulations are conducted at Reynolds number from 10 to 200, and three-dimensional large eddy simulations are conducted at subcritical Reynolds number ranging from 3900 to . The results show that larger drag coefficients and Strouhal numbers are attributed to surface roughness and sharp crowns on the rough cylinder. The obtained drag coefficient ranges from 1.1 to 1.2 with respect to the diameter of the mussel dropper and the peak value of the tidal velocities. Wakes behind rough cylinders fluctuate more actively compared to those of smooth cylinders. This research work provides new insight for further investigations on hydrodynamic interactions between fluid and mussel droppers.",Zhijing Xu and Hongde Qin and Peng Li and Rujun Liu,10.1177/0036850419901235,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0036850419901235,Science Progress,PMID:32024433,1,0036850419901235,Computational fluid dynamics approaches to drag and wake of a long-line mussel dropper under tidal current,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0036850419901235,103,2020i
article,doi:10.1177/07356331231213548,"Robotics education has received widespread attention in K-12 education. Studies have pointed out that in robotics courses, learners face challenges in learning abstract content, such as constructing a robot with a good structure and writing programs to drive a robot to complete specific learning tasks. The present study proposed the embodied learning-based computer programming approach and applied it to the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robotics course. To evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experiment was conducted in one public primary school to explore its effects on students’ learning achievement, learning motivation, learning attitudes, learning engagement, and cognitive load. The experimental group (40 students) adopted the embodied learning-based computer programming approach, while the control group (40 students) adopted the conventional computer programming approach. The results showed that the experimental group had significantly better learning achievement in robotics than the control group, and that there was no significant difference in the cognitive load of the two groups. In terms of learning motivation, although both groups showed improvement, the experimental group had higher intrinsic learning motivation. In addition, the experimental group outperformed the control group with regard to learning attitudes and learning engagement (including cognitive, behavioral, and emotional engagement). Accordingly, this study could contribute to future research for developing more effective robotics teaching approaches and computer programming activity design.",Xinli Zhang and Yuchen Chen and Danqing Li and Lailin Hu and Gwo-Jen Hwang and Yun-Fang Tu,10.1177/07356331231213548,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/07356331231213548,Journal of Educational Computing Research,,2,532–558,Engaging Young Students in Effective Robotics Education: An Embodied Learning-Based Computer Programming Approach,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/07356331231213548,62,2024j
