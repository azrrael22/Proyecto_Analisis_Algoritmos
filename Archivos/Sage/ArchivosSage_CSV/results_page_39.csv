article,doi:10.1177/104538902761696814,"In this paper we discuss the sound absorption property of arrays of micro-acoustic actuators at a control surface. We use the wave equation over the half plane for the velocity potential with a boundary dissipation by a proportional pressure feedback law along the half plane boundary. The feedback gain over the array is described by a distributed shape function. We develop a computational method based on the Fourier transform and employ it for analyzing and evaluating the decay rate of acoustic energy. Specifically, we carry out computations for a diffusive random initial field and report on our resulting numerical findings.",H. T. Banks and D. G. Cole and K. M. Furati and K. Ito and G. A.

article,doi:10.1177/09610006241265102,"This study aims to contribute to the pertinent body of knowledge by examining the field of data literacy (DL) to better understand its trends and evolution, thematic clusters, relevant studies and the most productive authors and journals. The analysis of scientific literature indexed by Web of Science from 1980 to 2023 (n = 1704 items) combined co-occurrence (using VOSviewer) and co-citation (using CiteSpace) techniques based on the words in the title and abstract, as well as the keywords, authors and journals. There is evidence of four main trend topics (Data Literacy, Statistical Literacy, Data-based assessment and e-society) and six thematic clusters (Data Literacy, Statistical Literacy, Quantitative Literacy, Big Data, Data Science and Quantitative Skills). With DL emerging in 2011, the research initially focused on both quantitative and statistical literacy, and later (2012–2016) shifted toward applying statistical literacy to various disciplines. Since 2018, the use of data has led to the emergence of fields like big data and data science, resulting in progress being made in data literacy. The combination of the two analysis techniques offers complementary perspectives: co-word analysis reveals fields of application, and co-citation analysis shows the internal evolution of the discipline. This study evidences a significant increase in publications on DL, indicating its expansion to several disciplines and a promising, yet uncertain, future.",Rosaura Fernández-Pascual and Maria Pinto and Francisco Javier García Marco,10.1177/09610006241265102,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/09610006241265102,Journal of Librarianship and Information Science,,0,09610006241265102,Emergence and evolution of data literacy: Insights from a bibliometric study,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/09610006241265102,0,2024b
article,doi:10.1177/15554120231211376,"This article analyzes the configuration of fear generated by the computational monster in computer games. We view the monster as a computational entity, which we approach through our theory of game-play coupled with the concepts of loss aversion and endowment effect. Of particular interest is player perception of the threat posed by monsters as they perturb the experience of progression and the sensation of control within the game. We scrutinize this aspect from a situational as well as an existential perspective. Furthermore, we advance an analytical scheme of the threat of the computational monster, which is radically different from the traditional academic approach with its emphasis on the representation of monsters. Overall, we argue that the threat players perceive when facing monsters in computer games springs more from the computational nature of monsters—how they upset progression and the feeling of control—and less from the representation of the monster(s).",Lasse Juel Larsen and Bo Kampmann Walther,10.1177/15554120231211376,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/15554120231211376,Games and Culture,,0,15554120231211376,Fear of Monsters: Toward an Understanding of the Threat of the Computational Monster Read Through the Theoretical Lens  of Game-Play,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/15554120231211376,0,2023c
article,doi:10.1179/174328509X431454,"Stainless steel alloys are widely used in many important applications but their production presents difficulties because they contain expensive chromium, which can be extensively oxidised during decarburisation to the very low carbon levels required. Modern stainless steelmaking largely avoids this problem by having two distinct stages and is therefore described as duplex practice. Molten high carbon stainless steel is produced in an electric arc furnace and then the melt is decarburised in an argon–oxygen converter or a vacuum oxygen decarburising converter. In this work, computational thermodynamics has been used to examine the major reactions occurring in the electric arc furnace and to show the effect of various process variables on chromium recovery. It was shown that significant oxidation of the scrap must occur during melting, and that subsequent carbon/oxygen injection initially oxidises some chromium, but then mostly oxidises the added carbon. Chromium was predicted to exist in the slag as CrO and CrO1·5 in almost equal proportions. Increasing the temperature should improve chromium recovery but results in less benefit than expected due to the decreasing activity coefficients of CrO and CrO1·5 and the increasing oxygen partial pressure. Ferrosilicon additions reduce chromium oxides from the slag, but much of the silicon simply dissolves into the steel. Computational thermodynamics is seen to be a very effective educational tool for gaining an understanding of smelting processes.",T. S. Kho and D. R. Swinbourne and B. Blanpain and S. Arnout and D.

article,doi:10.1177/07356331221143832,This study implemented and evaluated the innovative use of a performance-based assessment platform to support the development of self-regulated learning (SRL) in senior primary students as they completed programming tasks. We embedded SRL support features into a performance-based assessment platform as scaffolding to help the students implement problem-solving strategies. A mixed-methods approach was adopted to evaluate the intervention. The students’ perceptions of their SRL skills after working through the programming tasks were measured by a survey of 45 students. The quantitative results suggested that the students benefited from the performance-based assessment platform in developing their SRL skills. A thematic analysis of interview data from 20 students further indicated that the embedded SRL scaffolding and automatic marking function helped them to solve the programming tasks. The results demonstrate that a well-designed performance-based assessment platform with embedded SRL support can be an effective tool for developing students’ SRL. The qualitative results further revealed that algorithmic thinking is an aspect of programming for which students need more SRL support.,Siu-Cheung Kong and Bowen Liu,10.1177/07356331221143832,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/07356331221143832,Journal of Educational Computing Research,,5,977–1007,Supporting the Self-Regulated Learning of Primary School Students With a Performance-Based Assessment Platform for Programming Education,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/07356331221143832,61,2023e
article,doi:10.1177/0735633119887508,"This study implemented a data-driven approach to identify Chinese high school students’ common errors in a Java-based introductory programming course using the data in an automated assessment tool called the Mulberry. Students’ error-related behaviors were also analyzed, and their relationships to success in introductory programming were investigated. This study identified 15 common compilation errors and 6 common test errors. The results showed that these common errors accounted for a large proportion of all errors, so identifying the common errors is important to help students succeed in introductory programming courses. Based on these common errors, five underlying student difficulties were identified and are discussed. In addition, after analyzing existing measures of students’ error-related behaviors, we developed a measure called improvement rate to quantify students’ success in fixing errors. The results of our study suggest that students’ competence of improving code is important to their success in introductory programming. We recommend researchers design and develop automated assessment tools that provide feedback messages for common student errors and instructors who explicitly teach knowledge and skills of improving code in class.",Yizhou Qian and James Lehman,10.1177/0735633119887508,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0735633119887508,Journal of Educational Computing Research,,5,919–945,An Investigation of High School Students’ Errors in Introductory Programming: A Data-Driven Approach,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0735633119887508,58,2020f
article,doi:10.1177/2398212818810591,"Metacognition supports reflection upon and control of other cognitive processes. Despite metacognition occupying a central role in human psychology, its neural substrates remain underdetermined, partly due to study-specific differences in task domain and type of metacognitive judgement under study. It is also unclear how metacognition relates to other apparently similar abilities that depend on recursive thought such as theory of mind or mentalising. Now that neuroimaging studies of metacognition are more prevalent, we have an opportunity to characterise consistencies in neural substrates identified across different analysis types and domains. Here we used quantitative activation likelihood estimation methods to synthesise findings from 47 neuroimaging studies on metacognition, divided into categories based on the target of metacognitive evaluation (memory and decision-making), analysis type (judgement-related activation, confidence-related activation, and predictors of metacognitive sensitivity), and, for metamemory judgements, temporal focus (prospective and retrospective). A domain-general network, including medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and insula was associated with the level of confidence in self-performance in both decision-making and memory tasks. We found preferential engagement of right anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in metadecision experiments and bilateral parahippocampal cortex in metamemory experiments. Results on metacognitive sensitivity were inconclusive, likely due to fewer studies reporting this contrast. Finally, by comparing our results to meta-analyses of mentalising, we obtain evidence for common engagement of the ventromedial and anterior dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in both metacognition and mentalising, suggesting that these regions may support second-order representations for thinking about the thoughts of oneself and others.",Anthony G.

article,doi:10.1177/0738894215570433,"Many accounts of civil war violence assume that a conflict’s master cleavage also explains the local occurrence of violence. Some scholars, however, have argued that violence is often the result of local cleavages and feuds, many of which may be unrelated to the conflict’s master cleavage. How is local violence related to the conflict’s master cleavage? Using a computational model, this paper studies an alliance mechanism proposed by Kalyvas (2006, The Logic of Violence in Civil War, Cambridge University Press), where macro-actors support local ones that fight on their behalf. While these alliances create a principal–agent problem, the model shows that they can raise the overall severity of the conflict and serve the interests of the macro-actor. However, the model also shows that these mechanisms work only under limited conditions. Alliances can increase the level of violence perpetrated in the interest of the macro-actor, but only if (a) the latter supports agents that have in the past fought along the master cleavage and if (b) this happens in rural areas. This emphasizes again the importance of the rural dimension in the study of civil war.",Nils B.

article,doi:10.1177/1729881418766190,"Accurate calculation of canopy aerodynamic parameters is a prerequisite for precise modeling of a parafoil airdrop system. This investigation analyses the aerodynamic performance of the canopy in airdrop testing combining the leading-edge incision and the trailing-edge deflection. Aerodynamic parameters of the canopy are obtained using the computational fluid dynamic simulations, and then, the output data are used to estimate the deflection and incision factors. The estimated lift and drag coefficients instead of the traditional parameters based on lifting-line theory are incorporated into the eight degrees of freedom dynamic model of an airdrop system and make some simulations. The effectiveness of the proposed method for calculating aerodynamic coefficients is verified by actual airdrop testing.",Wannan Wu and Qinglin Sun and Shuzhen Luo and Mingwei Sun and Zengqiang Chen and Hao Sun,10.1177/1729881418766190,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1729881418766190,International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems,,2,1729881418766190,Accurate calculation of aerodynamic coefficients of parafoil airdrop system based on computational fluid dynamic,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1729881418766190,15,2018i
article,doi:10.1177/0049124115610347,"Model uncertainty is pervasive in social science. A key question is how robust empirical results are to sensible changes in model specification. We present a new approach and applied statistical software for computational multimodel analysis. Our approach proceeds in two steps: First, we estimate the modeling distribution of estimates across all combinations of possible controls as well as specified functional form issues, variable definitions, standard error calculations, and estimation commands. This allows analysts to present their core, preferred estimate in the context of a distribution of plausible estimates. Second, we develop a model influence analysis showing how each model ingredient affects the coefficient of interest. This shows which model assumptions, if any, are critical to obtaining an empirical result. We demonstrate the architecture and interpretation of multimodel analysis using data on the union wage premium, gender dynamics in mortgage lending, and tax flight migration among U.S. states. These illustrate how initial results can be strongly robust to alternative model specifications or remarkably dependent on a knife-edge specification.",Cristobal Young and Katherine Holsteen,10.1177/0049124115610347,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0049124115610347,Sociological Methods & Research,,1,3–40,Model Uncertainty and Robustness: A Computational Framework for Multimodel Analysis,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0049124115610347,46,2017j
