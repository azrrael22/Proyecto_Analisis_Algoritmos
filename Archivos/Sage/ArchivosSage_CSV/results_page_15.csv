article,doi:10.1177/02666669211049135,"New information and computer technologies transform the social interaction and impose new demands for skills and thinking upon media specialists. The aim of this study is to determine the most effective set of information technologies, which can help media specialists develop competencies and thus stay competitive in the labor market. The research methodology is based on the overview of case studies concerning issues such as technology trends, human capital, and talent competitiveness. The qualitative analysis was performed in three phases – overviewing case studies, distinguishing trends and problem-solving. Analyzing data on skill supply and demand, the key skills needed to succeed in the workplace were identified. The results of the three-phase research revealed that the most important competencies needed to be in demand today are technology literacy, stress tolerance, and big data skills. The major finding of this study is that a media specialist needs to focus on learning throughout his life and gain hard and soft skills in the process.",Nidal Al Said and Butheyna Zuheir Al-Rawashdeh,10.1177/02666669211049135,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/02666669211049135,Information Development,3,380–390,Information and computer technologies in media specialist preparation,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/02666669211049135,38,2022a
article,doi:10.1177/14780771241279347,"Hybrid girihs refer to Islamic geometric patterns that include various stars/rosettes in their final pattern. In this paper, we first identified historical hybrid girihs and then categorized them based on symmetry groups and the number of stars/rosettes folds. In the next step, we analyzed the existing hybrid girihs to identify the generative parameters and present a method for generating historical and novel systematic and non-systematic hybrid girihs. The proposed method of this paper is a computational and parametric approach based on the symmetry groups theory. Its general steps include generating the minimal essential information (template motif) within the fundamental region, applying appropriate symmetry operations on the content of the fundamental region to create the content of the unit girih, and replicating the content of the unit girih in a suitable network according to the symmetry group to create the whole pattern. Our method is used to generate hybrid girih for adorning surfaces in digital spaces and for constructing facade modules (adorned with Islamic geometric patterns) and interior decorative partitions and furniture in physical spaces according to the aesthetic judgment of users.",Ali Azizi Naserabad and Abdulhamid Ghanbaran,10.1177/14780771241279347,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/14780771241279347,International Journal of Architectural Computing,0,14780771241279348,Computational approach in presentation a parametric method to construct hybrid girihs (hybrid Islamic geometric patterns),https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/14780771241279347,0,2024b

Processes that have always been important for gifted students to learn as they develop potential are embedded in learning code, which engages the beginning programmer in rich and complex authentic projects (Housand et al., 2017). As stakeholders present opportunities for open-ended, creative processes and products, the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA; 2017) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE; 2016) Standards can form guidelines for gifted students to self-direct their education through technology. Learning to code results in both cognitive and psychosocial skill development, including creative and critical thinking, logical and systematic reasoning, positive risk-taking and processing of feedback, perseverance through challenges, social skills, and collaboration.",Maryann R.

article,doi:10.1080/02103702.1992.10822322,"Piaget’s (1953, 1955) increasingly controversial claim that infant knowledge depends upon action need not be rejected, provided the mechanisms underlying infant ability are conceptualized appropriately in computational terms. Computational concepts solve many problems caused by Piaget’s notions of perception, behaviour, schemes, reciprocal-assimilation and action. Artificial intelligence work on vision offers a way of explaining early perceptual abilities that is precise, internally coherent and able to encompass recent findings of innate organization. Concepts from the procedural programming languages offer a way of accounting for both internal and overt aspects of behaviour, and for the functional coordination of perception and behaviour that characterizes infant anion. This perspective challenges Piaget’s view that development necessitates a radical reconstruction of action-based knowledge. Conceptualized computationally, perceptual-behavioural action can be seen to involve representation in a nontrivial sense. Restructuring of action mechanisms can account for some central phenomena of infant development.",Julie C.

article,doi:10.1177/14782103231178069,"While a small number of school districts across the United States are well into the process of implementing system-wide computer science education (CSed), most districts are only just getting started. But what does it look like to “get started” on CSed for a whole district? This manuscript presents a single case study of a district’s process of initiating their CS instructional initiative, highlighting a distinct set of instructional leadership practices and the institutional conditions they were responding to. Early implementation research around CSed shows that in some districts, leadership practices are less often the focus of early activities. This study sheds light on what such leadership practices can look like in the early stages of a district’s CSed initiative. Our analysis, based on qualitative data collected longitudinally over 18 months of the district’s work, identified eight intertwined leadership practices that aimed to support instructional coherence, and in our findings, we share a narrative of the district’s initiation of its CS initiative around them. The case begins with the (1) initial leadership team formation and details how that team engaged in (2) content-specific instructional capacity building for its members and (3) sensemaking of ideas around CS with their relationship to existing district activities. It moves on to the team’s (4) development of an instructional vision and an (5) associated implementation strategy, which fed into processes of (6) sensegiving to foster buy-in among teachers, and providing encouragement to engage in (7) instructional piloting. Finally, leaders engaged in (8) landscape analysis activities in order to understand existing district resources and teacher perceptions related to CS. Throughout the case, we highlight the motivations behind these practices, what resources they drew on, intersections, and dependencies among them. We close our analysis exploring a number of tensions and unintended consequences associated with these leadership activities.",Rafi Santo and Leigh Ann DeLyser and June Ahn,10.1177/14782103231178069,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/14782103231178069,Policy Futures in Education,0,14782103231178068,Booting the system: Leadership practices for initiating and infrastructuring district-wide computer science instructional programs,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/14782103231178069,0,2023g
article,doi:10.1177/07356331211053383,"Scratch, a kind of visual programming software, has been widely used in instruction for primary school children. Scratch constructs a digital world for children to design, develop, and create coursework in which their creative thinking is fostered. Different instructional methods have been designed and implemented to stimulate children’s creative thinking skills through their coursework. This study investigated whether scaffolding construction with mind mapping promoted children’s creative thinking in a Scratch course. Two groups of 84 fifth-grade pupils participated in the study. The experimental group of 44 students adopted the scaffolding construction with mind mapping in the Scratch course, while the control group of 40 students did not use the mind mapping method. The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking-Figural (TTCT-F) and Torrance Creative Personality Self-Report Scale were used three times over the 16-week learning period. The results show that learning in the Scratch course promoted the children’s creative thinking. The difference between the two groups indicates that mind mapping was beneficial to improve the children’s creative thinking.",Yu-Sheng Su and Mingming Shao and Li Zhao,10.1177/07356331211053383,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/07356331211053383,Journal of Educational Computing Research,4,906–929,Effect of Mind Mapping on Creative Thinking of Children in Scratch Visual Programming Education,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/07356331211053383,60,2022h
article,doi:10.1177/21582440231179710,"This study investigated the effect of educational board games and the creative thinking spiral teaching strategy (CTSTS) on the learning outcomes of beginner-level Chinese language learners. Two dimensions were measured: learning outcome and writing ability. A total of 82 learners from one university in Taiwan participated in this study. Participants were non-randomly selected using convenience sampling. The participants were divided into the control group (40 participants) and experimental group (42 participants). In the control group, the teacher used the board game “Conveyance GO” as a teaching tool; in the experimental group, both Conveyance GO and CTSTS were used to teach the Chinese language. The results indicate no significant difference in learning outcomes between the groups. However, the experimental group exhibited a significantly larger improvement in writing abilities than did the control group, especially in terms of cohesion, coherence, and grammatical accuracy.",Ju-May Wen and Hai-Dung Do and Eric Zhi-Feng Liu and Chun-Hung Lin and Shihping Kevin Huang,10.1177/21582440231179710,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/21582440231179710,Sage Open,3,21582440231179710,Strengthening Writing Ability Among Students Learning Chinese as a Second Language Through Creative Thinking Spiral Teaching Strategy,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/21582440231179710,13,2023i
article,doi:10.1177/07356331231174929,"Coding is increasingly popular in schools around the world and is often taught by non-specialist teachers as an integrated task with other subject areas. In this article, we explore the relationship between computer science (CS) concepts and students’ multimodal expression in a coding animated narrative (CAN) task in the context of an integrated English-Technology unit of learning. Through this collective case study, we explore how CS concepts underpin semiotic elements of an animated narrative, analyse the factors that influence the extent to which students exercise those concepts, and reveal the tensions and opportunities that a CAN task may present for learning computer science concepts in regular, non-specialist, cross-curricular classrooms. The findings suggest that CAN tasks are unique in presenting opportunities for students to learn challenging CS concepts such as synchronisation and parallelism. At the same time, CAN tasks present tensions for teaching CS concepts in non-specialist classrooms, where student projects are often judged on their visual qualities. In such settings, procedural, rather than conceptual knowledge, may be a more efficient route to creative outcomes. It also means that drawing skills need to be prioritised. Role specialisation often led to better quality projects but at the expense of individual students’ conceptual development in computer science.",Karen Woo and Garry Falloon,10.1177/07356331231174929,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/07356331231174929,Journal of Educational Computing Research,7,1335–1358,The Search for Computer Science Concepts in Coding Animated Narratives: Tensions and Opportunities,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/07356331231174929,61,2023j
