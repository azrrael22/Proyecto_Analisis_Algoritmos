article,doi:10.1179/030192310X12731438631804,"All operations in process metallurgy involve complex phenomena comprising momentum, heat, and/or mass transport; iron- and steelmaking is not an exception. Transport phenomena, i.e. fluid flows, heat transfer and mass transfer, play a dominant role in process metallurgy since their respective laws govern the kinetics of the various physical phenomena occurring in ironmaking and in steelmaking. These phenomena include such events as three-phase reactions, entrainment of slag and gas in liquid steel, vacuum degassing, alloy melting and mixing, the movements and flotation of inclusions, melt temperature losses, residence times in a metallurgical reactor, erosion of refractory linings, etc. In all these aspects, the evolution in our techniques and abilities to model single and multiphase flows and their attendant heat and mass transfer processes has contributed significantly to our understanding and effectively operating these processes, to designing improvements, and to developing new processes. To be ignorant of these matters can doom a processing operation to the scrap heap of metallurgical failures. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational heat and mass transfer has been a very effective tool over the last three decades, for modelling iron- and steelmaking processes, starting from the blast furnace up to continuous casting and beyond. With the advent of commercial CFD packages and ever increasing computational power through parallel processing, CFD has now become the dominant approach for predicting various aspects in iron- and steelmaking processes. In Part 1 of this review paper, the applications of CFD in ironmaking processes are thoroughly reviewed, discussed and critiqued. In Part 2, fluid flows and CFD in steelmaking and steel casting processes are similarly reviewed and critiqued.",K. Chattopadhyay and M. Isac and R. I. L.

article,doi:10.1177/0894439320951766,"The increasing availability of data, along with sophisticated computational methods for analyzing them, presents researchers with new opportunities and challenges. In this article, we address both by describing computational and network methods that can be used to identify cases of rare phenomena. We evaluate each method’s relative utility in the identification of a specific rare phenomenon of interest to social movement researchers: the spillover of social movement claims from one movement to another. We identify and test five different approaches to detecting cases of spillover in the largest data set of protest events currently available, finding that an ensemble approach that combines clique and correspondence analysis and an ensemble approach combining all methods perform considerably better than others. Our approach is preferable to other ways of analyzing such cases; compared to qualitative approaches, our computational process identifies many more cases of spillover—some of which are surprising and would likely not be otherwise investigated. At the same time, compared to crude quantitative measures, our approach substantially reduces the “noise,” or identification of false-positive cases, of movement spillover. We argue that this technique, which can be adapted to other research topics, is a good illustration of how the thoughtful implementation of computational methods can allow for the efficient identification of rare events and also bridge deductive and inductive approaches to scientific inquiry.",Thomas Elliott and Misty Ring-Ramirez and Jennifer Earl,10.1177/0894439320951766,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0894439320951766,Social Science Computer Review,,5,981–1002,Spillover as Movement Agenda Setting: Using Computational and Network Techniques for Improved Rare Event Identification,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0894439320951766,39,2021b
article,doi:10.1177/0022219407311003,"Knowledge and skill in multiplication were investigated for late elementary-grade students with mathematics learning disabilities (MLD), typically achieving age-matched peers, low-achieving age-matched peers, and ability-matched peers by examining multiple measures of computational skill, working memory, and conceptual knowledge. Poor multiplication fact mastery and calculation fluency and general working memory discriminated children with MLD from typically achieving age-matched peers. Furthermore, children with MLD were slower in executing backup procedures than typically achieving age-matched peers. The performance of children with MLD on multiple measures of multiplication skill and knowledge was most similar to that of ability-matched younger children. MLD may be due to difficulties in computational skills and working memory. Implications for the diagnosis and remediation of MLD are discussed.",Donald J.

article,doi:10.1177/0954411915626742,"The current criterion for surgical intervention in abdominal aortic aneurysms, based upon a maximal aortic diameter, is considered conservative due to the high mortality rate in case of rupture. The research community is actively investigating the use of computational mechanics tools combined with patient-specific imaging to help identify more accurate criteria. Widespread uptake of a successful metric will however be limited by the need for computed tomography, which is at present the primary image extraction method on account of the location and complex shape of the aneurysms. The use of three-dimensional ultrasound as the scanning method is more attractive on account of increased availability, reduced cost and reduced risk to patients. The suitability of three-dimensional ultrasound is assessed for this purpose in the present work; computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed on geometries obtained from the same patient using both ultrasound and computed tomography. The influence of different smoothing algorithms is investigated in the geometry preparation stage and Taubin’s low-pass filter was found to best preserve geometry features. Laminar, Newtonian, steady-state simulation analysis identified haemodynamic characteristics to be qualitatively similar in terms of wall shear stress, velocity and vorticity. The study demonstrates the potential for three-dimensional ultrasound to be integrated into a more accessible patient-specific modelling tool able to identify the need for surgical intervention of abdominal aortic aneurysms.",Benjamin Owen and Christopher Lowe and Neil Ashton and Parthasarathi Mandal and Steven Rogers and Wolfgang Wein and Charles McCollum and Alistair Revell,10.1177/0954411915626742,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0954411915626742,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine",PMID:26893226,3,201–210,Computational hemodynamics of abdominal aortic aneurysms: Three-dimensional ultrasound versus computed tomography,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0954411915626742,230,2016d
article,doi:10.4137/BBI.S13403,"Sea anemone neurotoxins are peptides that interact with Na+ and K+ channels, resulting in specific alterations on their functions. Some of these neurotoxins (1ROO, 1BGK, 2K9E, 1BEI) are important for the treatment of about 80 autoimmune disorders because of their specificity for Kv1.3 channel. The aim of this study was to identify the common residues among these neurotoxins by computational methods, and establish whether there is a pattern useful for the future generation of a treatment for autoimmune diseases. Our results showed eight new key common residues between the studied neurotoxins interacting with a histidine ring and the selectivity filter of the receptor, thus showing a possible pattern of interaction. This knowledge may serve as an input for the design of more promising drugs for autoimmune treatments.",Angélica Sabogal-Arango and George E.

article,doi:10.1177/1094428112449655,"Theorists in management and organizational science rarely use computational modeling to support theoretical development or refinement, particularly at the micro level of analysis. This article argues that organizational scholars, who strive to understand dynamic behavior in a complex context, are particularly in need of the support computational models offer. Moreover, organizational scholars can build on (a) the plethora of informal theories extant in the literature and (b) the computational architectures and model building platforms developed in recent years. To increase the number of organizational scholars building and evaluating computational models, the article provides a tutorial in model building and simulation. Specifically, a new computational model is built and assessed. Surprising realizations emerge in the process. There is also an extensive section on model evaluation involving empirical observations.",Jeffrey B. Vancouver and Justin M.

article,doi:10.1177/1687814017734109,"Mesh partitioning is significant to the efficiency of parallel computational fluid dynamics simulations. The most time-consuming parts of parallel computational fluid dynamics simulations are iteratively solving linear systems derived from partial differential equation discretizations. This article aims at mesh partitioning for better iterative convergence feature of this procedure. For typical computational fluid dynamics simulations in which partial differential equations are discretized and solved after the mesh is partitioned, numerical information of the linear systems is not available yet during mesh partitioning. We propose to construct approximations for matrix elements and theoretically find out that for finite-volume-based problems, the face area can approximate the corresponding matrix element well. A mesh partitioning scheme using the matrix value approximations for better iterative convergence behavior is implemented and numerically testified. The results show that our method can capture the most important factor influencing the matrix values and achieve partitions with good performance throughout the simulations with non-uniform meshes. The novel partitioning strategy is general and easy to implement in various partitioning packages.",Miao Wang and Xinhai Xu and Xiaoguang Ren and Chao Li and Juan Chen and Xuejun Yang,10.1177/1687814017734109,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1687814017734109,Advances in Mechanical Engineering,,11,1687814017734109,Mesh partitioning using matrix value approximations for parallel computational fluid dynamics simulations,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1687814017734109,9,2017g
article,doi:10.1177/08944393211058112,"Since its inception, computational social science (CSS) has been characterized as an interdisciplinary field. Nevertheless, unlike a mature interdisciplinary field that duly integrates knowledge beyond disciplinary boundaries, CSS has arguably been fragmented into multiple lines of inquiry. Although such fragmentation has been a constant concern, limited empirical evidence exists to substantiate any degree of integration in research on CSS. To systematically map the landscape of research on CSS, we examined the dynamic topology of the bibliometric network of CSS during the past 20 years. By comparing the structure of the coupling network and the co-subject network with three prototypical network models that we simulated—the centralized model, the fragmented model, and the cohesive model—our analysis revealed that the citation networks of research on CSS are highly centralized but less fragmented than often assumed. Beyond that, a driving factor shaping the coupling network’s cohesive structure is the citation to high-impact articles. Those and other findings contribute to current understandings of the process of integration in the evolution of disciplines.",Xiaohui Wang and Yunya Song and Youzhen Su,10.1177/08944393211058112,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/08944393211058112,Social Science Computer Review,,3,946–966,Less Fragmented but Highly Centralized: A Bibliometric Analysis of Research in Computational Social Science,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/08944393211058112,41,2023h
article,doi:10.1080/19462166.2010.485698,"This paper reports our research concerning dialogue strategies suitable for adoption by a human–computer debating system. We propose a set of strategic heuristics for a computer to adopt to enable it to function as a dialogue participant. In particular, we consider means of assessing the proposed strategy. A system involving two agents in dialogue with each other and a human–agent debate system are constructed and subsequently used to facilitate the evaluations. The evaluations suggest that the proposed strategy can enable the computer to act as an effective dialogue participant. It is anticipated that this work will contribute towards the development of computerised dialogue systems and help to illuminate research issues concerning strategies in dialectical systems.",Tangming Yuan and David Moore and Alec Grierson,10.1080/19462166.2010.485698,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1080/19462166.2010.485698,Argument & Computation,,3,215–248,Assessing debate strategies via computational agents,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1080/19462166.2010.485698,1,2010i
article,doi:10.1177/20965311241265373,"Purpose This article takes a postfoundational lens to reflect upon my ethnographic (re)searching experience in a Hong Kong high school biology classroom to expose ignorant theoretical–methodological assumptions of researchers and teachers on critical thinking for new realizations. Design/Approach/Methods Using an encountered embodied thinking moment as a trigger, this article examines the texts/discourses collected from teachers/teaching and students/learning to unpack underlying philosophical–theoretical–methodological traps and ignorance. Findings The analysis exposes three ignorant assumptions. First is a mind–body dualism that has historically disembodied thinking as an abstract and invisible mind/cognitive activity. Second is a knowledge–skill/thinking divide that upgrades critical thinking as a transferrable higher-order skill above and external to knowledge. Third is a naturalized assumption that didactic instructions in Asian classrooms are not as conducive to thinking cultivation as (Western) student-centered pedagogies. Originality/Value My postfoundational reflections interrogate and expand these philosophical–theoretical–methodological grounds to reconstruct effective thinking curricula and classrooms.",Weili Zhao (赵伟黎),10.1177/20965311241265373,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/20965311241265373,ECNU Review of Education,,0,20965311241265372,(Re)Searching Critical Thinking in a Hong Kong Classroom: A Postfoundational Reflection on Ignorant Modernity,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/20965311241265373,0,2024j
