article,doi:10.1177/0263276418818884,"In our contemporary moment, when machine learning algorithms are reshaping many aspects of society, the work of N. Katherine Hayles stands as a powerful corpus for understanding what is at stake in a new regime of computation. A renowned literary theorist whose work bridges the humanities and sciences among her many works, Hayles has detailed ways to think about embodiment in an age of virtuality (How We Became Posthuman, 1999), how code as performative practice is located (My Mother Was a Computer, 2005), and the reciprocal relations among human bodies and technics (How We Think, 2012). This special issue follows the 2017 publication of her book Unthought: The Power of the Cognitive Nonconscious, in which Hayles traces the nonconscious cognition of biological life-forms and computational media. The articles in the special issue respond in different ways to Hayles’ oeuvre, mapping the specific contours of computational regimes and developing some of the ‘inflection points’ she advocates in the deep engagement with technical systems.",Louise Amoore,10.1177/0263276418818884,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0263276418818884,"Theory, Culture & Society",2,3–16,Introduction: Thinking with Algorithms: Cognition and Computation in the Work of N.

article,doi:10.1177/14780771221121829,"In the fourth industrial revolution, programming promises to be a fundamental subject like mathematics, science, languages ​​or the arts. Architects design more than buildings developing innovative methods and they are among the pioneers in visual programming development. However, after more than 10 years of visual programming in architecture, despite the fast-learning curve, visual programming presents considerable limitations to solve complex problems. To overcome limitations, the authors propose to associate the advantages of visual and textual languages in Python. The article addresses an ongoing research study to implement Computational Methods in Architectural Education. The authors began by describing the general goal of this project, and of this article in particular. This article focuses on the implementation of two disciplines ‘Computation for Architecture in Python’ I and II. The first discipline uses programming based on the construction of functions in the imperative language, implemented in the text editor, in visual programming, using Grasshopper methods. The second discipline, which is under development, intends to teach object-oriented programming. The results of the first discipline are encouraging; despite reported difficulties in programming fundamentals, such as lists, loops and recursion. The development of the second discipline, in object-oriented programming, deals with the concepts of classes and objects, and more abstract principles such abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism or encapsulation. This paradigm allows building robust programs, but requires a more in-depth syntax. The article reports this ongoing research on this new paradigm of object-oriented language, expanding the application of a hybrid visual-textual language in Architecture.",Goncalo Castro Henriques and Pedro Maciel Xavier and Victor de Luca Silva and Luca Rédua Bispo and João Victor Fraga,10.1177/14780771221121829,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/14780771221121829,International Journal of Architectural Computing,3,673–687,"Computation for Architecture, hybrid visual and textual language: Research developments and considerations about the implementation of structural imperative and object-oriented paradigms",https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/14780771221121829,20,2022b
article,doi:10.3102/0013189X20923708,"With the release of the consensus report English Learners in STEM Subjects: Transforming Classrooms, Schools, and Lives, we highlight foundational constructs and perspectives associated with STEM subjects and language with English learners (ELs) that frame the report. The purpose here is to elevate these constructs and perspectives for discussion among the broader education research community. First, we provide an overview of the unique contributions of the report to move the ELs and STEM fields forward. Second, we describe ELs in terms of their heterogeneity and the inconsistency of educational policies that affect their learning opportunities in STEM subjects. Third, we describe contemporary views on STEM subjects and language with ELs that indicate that instructional shifts across STEM subjects and language are mutually supportive. Fourth, we describe promising instructional strategies to promote STEM learning and language development with ELs. Lastly, we close the article by reimagining STEM education with ELs and offer potential next steps. These foundational constructs and perspectives on STEM subjects and language with ELs are critical because they provide the conceptual grounding for the design of the education system for ELs. The report could contribute to building a knowledge base for ELs in STEM subjects and language as education research, policy, and practice converge to reimagine what is possible to both support and challenge ELs to learn academically rigorous content standards that are expected of all students.",Okhee Lee and Amy Stephens,10.3102/0013189X20923708,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.3102/0013189X20923708,Educational Researcher,6,426–432,English Learners in STEM Subjects: Contemporary Views on STEM Subjects and Language With English Learners,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.3102/0013189X20923708,49,2020c
article,doi:10.1177/20427530211022964,"This article explores the use of modding as a formal tool for learning history. The article examines data from a formal analysis of Europa Universalis IV (EUIV), a survey of 331 EUIV forum participants and a case study of 18 university participants. Significant quantitative survey data indicated that 45% (149/331) of participants had modified EUIV, and of the 125 participants who responded with comments about modding, a significant number (86/125 responses or 68.8%) explained how they had learnt about history, geography or other subjects through the modding process. Closer analysis of survey and case study responses and mods reveals the variety of ways participants learnt and critiqued history through the modding process. The article discusses the data and the pedagogical affordance of modding in a few steps. First, the article briefly explores the evidence that indicates modding is popular within the EUIV gaming community. In this instance, it examines whether given the popularity of gaming practice, modding might also be seen as a new casual form of engagement with games. Second, the article reviews the modding process in EUIV and examines how both playing and creating mods may be beneficial for learning history. Modding is examined in terms of its pedagogical importance and the unique educational opportunities it may offer that are not otherwise accessible through other forms of game-based learning. Finally, the article explores how and what the case study participants learnt when they were tasked with creating and implementing playable mods to demonstrate their understanding of history. Overall, the article considers the growing importance of mods, how learners can create and represent history using mods and how mods can provide a platform for learners to develop their own critique and analysis of official history.",Rhett Loban,10.1177/20427530211022964,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/20427530211022964,E-Learning and Digital Media,6,530–556,Modding Europa Universalis IV: An informal gaming practice transposed into a formal learning setting,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/20427530211022964,18,2021d
article,doi:10.3233/IA-2011-0017,"We describe recent work on the deployment of computational logic to support the formalisation and implementation of agents in multi-agent systems. Several forms of computational logic systems are needed in this setting, including abductive, argumentative and preference-based systems.

article,doi:10.1177/0306419019876866,"Computational fluid dynamics is taught in many universities and is a trending elective option among engineering students. Although analyzing computational fluid dynamics simulations is exciting enough, the theory is equation intensive, sometimes very abstract and also difficult to visualize for the novice. A creative thinking based approach termed synectics, which involves analogies, was therefore applied in classroom teaching to increase student comfort with the equations. For this purpose six analogies encompassing basic computational fluid dynamics concepts were developed along with pictorial representations, and are presented in this work. These analogies were integrated into classroom teaching via synectics procedures. Student feedback was positive and reflected higher engagement with the course compared to when the metaphoric activity was not implemented. This work attempts to demonstrate the feasibility and value of applying creative techniques, even when teaching a highly structured and equation oriented course such as computational fluid dynamics.",PC Sande and S Sharma,10.1177/0306419019876866,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0306419019876866,International Journal of Mechanical Engineering Education,2,171–191,Synectics model applied in basic theory of computational fluid dynamics,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0306419019876866,49,2021f
