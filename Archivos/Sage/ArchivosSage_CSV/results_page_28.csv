article,doi:10.1177/09544100241234374,"The capability for solving compressible fluid flows in the rotating frame of reference is added to an existed open-source CFD solver, namely, HiSA solver. The new implementation is explained and validated using the experimental data of the Sikorsky S-76 rotor. A comparison is presented between the moving mesh results obtained from the original HiSA code and the single rotating frame results achieved through the new implementation. The comparison includes an analysis of torque and thrust values, as well as computational costs. The results imply that, for evaluating the performance of an isolated rotor or for shape optimization purposes at the transonic regime, the single rotating frame method, like the one introduced in the current work, can provide accurate results within an acceptable computational budget. Furthermore, the results show that, at least 25 revolutions are required for the transient analysis to reach an acceptable steady-state converged solution like the one obtained by the single rotating frame method.",Saleh Abuhanieh,10.1177/09544100241234374,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/09544100241234374,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering",,6,582–595,Development of a steady-state computational fluid dynamics solver for transonic rotorcraft flows,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/09544100241234374,238,2024a
article,doi:10.1177/1478077120919850,"Computational design affords agency: the ability to orchestrate the material, spatial, and technical architectural system. In this specific case, it occurs through enhanced, authored means to facilitate making and performance—typically driven by concerns of structural optimization, material use, and responsivity to environmental factors—of an atmospheric rather than social nature. At issue is the positioning of this particular manner of agency solely with the architect auteur. This abruptly halts—at the moment in which fabrication commences—the ability to amend, redefine, or newly introduce fundamentally transformational constituents and their interrelationships and, most importantly, to explore the possibility for extraordinary outcomes. When the architecture becomes a functional, social, and cultural entity, in the hands of the idealized abled-bodied user, agency—especially for one of an otherly body or mind—is long gone. Even an empathetic auteur may not be able to access the motivations of the differently-abled body and neuro-divergent mind, effectively locking the constraints of the design process, which creates an exclusionary system to those beyond the purview of said auteur. It can therefore be deduced that the mechanisms or authors of a conventional computational design process cannot eradicate the exclusionary reality of an architectural system. Agency is critical, yet a more expansive terminology for agent and agency is needed. The burden to conceive of capacities that will always be highly temporal, social, unpredictable, and purposefully unknown must be shifted far from the scope of the traditional directors of the architectural system. Agency, and who it is conferred upon, must function in a manner that dissolves the distinctions between the design, the action of designing, the author of design, and those subjected to it.",Sean Ahlquist,10.1177/1478077120919850,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1478077120919850,International Journal of Architectural Computing,,2,174–193,Negotiating human engagement and the fixity of computational design: Toward a performative design space for the differently-abled bodymind,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1478077120919850,18,2020b
article,doi:10.1177/1461444812465137,"This article advances a sociological approach to computational journalism. By “computational journalism” the article refers to the increasingly ubiquitous forms of algorithmic, social scientific, and mathematical forms of newswork adopted by many 21st-century newsrooms and touted by many educational institutions as “the future of news.” By “sociological approach,” the article endorses a research model that brackets, at least temporarily, many of the current industry concerns with the practical usability of newsroom analysis. The bulk of the article outlines a series of six lenses through which such an approach to computational journalism might be carried out. Four of these lenses are drawn from Schudson’s classic typology of the sociology of news—economic, political, cultural, and organizational approaches. In addition, the author adds Bordieuean field approaches and technological lenses to the mix. In each instance, the author discusses how particular approaches might need to be modified in order to study computational journalism in the digital age.",CW Anderson,10.1177/1461444812465137,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1461444812465137,New Media & Society,,7,1005–1021,Towards a sociology of computational and algorithmic journalism,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1461444812465137,15,2013c
article,doi:10.1177/2167702614562041,"Schizophrenia is an illness with a remarkably complex symptom presentation that has thus far been out of reach of neuroscientific explanation. This presents a fundamental problem for developing better treatments that target specific symptoms or root causes. One promising path forward is the incorporation of computational neuroscience, which provides a way to formalize experimental observations and, in turn, make theoretical predictions for subsequent studies. We review three complementary approaches: (a) biophysically based models developed to test cellular-level and synaptic hypotheses, (b) connectionist models that give insight into large-scale neural-system-level disturbances in schizophrenia, and (c) models that provide a formalism for observations of complex behavioral deficits, such as negative symptoms. We argue that harnessing all of these modeling approaches represents a productive approach for better understanding schizophrenia. We discuss how blending these approaches can allow the field to progress toward a more comprehensive understanding of schizophrenia and its treatment.",Alan Anticevic and John D. Murray and Deanna M.

article,doi:10.1177/20539517211069892,"This commentary elaborates on the ideas and projects outlined in this special issue, from a specifically sociological perspective. Much recent work in sociology proposes ‘methods mashups’ of ethnography and digital data/computational tools in different and diverse ways. However, typically, these have taken the form of applying (with or without tweaks) the principles of ethnography to new domains and data types, as if ethnography itself is stable and immutable; that it has a universal set of methodological principles that unify ethnographic practice. Returning to anthropology (whence, arguably, ethnography originally came) is, therefore, a useful way to extend our methodological thinking to (re)consider what ethnography is and how it operates, and from there think more clearly about how it may be effectively combined with digital data/computational tools in an emerging ‘Computational Anthropology’.",Phillip Brooker,10.1177/20539517211069892,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/20539517211069892,Big Data & Society,,1,20539517211069892,Computational ethnography:  A view from sociology,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/20539517211069892,9,2022g
article,doi:10.1177/0309524X17709724,"In this article, the implementation of the pitch-control option is described within the OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics library supported by the preliminary results for a few representative test cases. The proposed pitch-control logic represents a simplified version of the typically model available for the load simulation based on blade element momentum theory codes. The control variable for the blade pitch regulation is the rotor rotational speed, for which an additional torque-speed controller determining the equilibrium between the aerodynamic and the electrical torque is required. The simulations are performed on the 80-m-diameter turbine used as a reference design within the SmartBlades project. The unsteady test cases are based on the assumption of rigid, not pre-bend blade, and refer to an emergency stop and an extreme operating gust. Results verified the correctness of the implemented control logic and its sensitivity to the control parameters, that is, the key factors for a successful regulation of power production and load mitigation in wind turbine design. The implemented simulation methodology constitutes the first step toward the reproduction of very complex operating conditions for wind turbines by means of accurate computations.",Elia Daniele,10.1177/0309524X17709724,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0309524X17709724,Wind Engineering,,4,213–225,Wind turbine control in computational fluid dynamics with OpenFOAM,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0309524X17709724,41,2017h
article,doi:10.5301/jva.5000241,"Background The creation and management of an autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as vascular access (VA) for hemodialysis patients is still a critical procedure. The placement of a functional and long-lasting VA derives from adequate planning of the surgical procedure based on physical examination, vascular mapping and selection of the best modality for arteriovenous anastomosis. The risk of AVF non-maturation and early failure is high, even when all precautions are taken to minimize these events. In addition, AVF surgery may develop very high blood flow exposing the patient to the risk of heart failure or hand ischemia. Methods The choices of the surgeons on the modalities to perform a surgical intervention for AVF should take into consideration several factors including patient clinical condition, arterial and venous vessel sizes and elasticity. However, these evaluations cannot give direct indication on VA outcome in terms of blood flow after AVF maturation. We then took advantage of theoretical models of vascular network hemodynamics and of computational fluid dynamics to develop a numerical tool for the prediction of potential blood flow of a planned VA surgery on the basis of preoperative ultrasound evaluation of arterial and venous sizes and blood flow. Results Here we present the numerical model, previously developed and tested, and we describe the web-based application that has been developed to help during surgical planning. Conclusions The use of this tool in the clinical setting should allow to reduce the incidence of AVF non-maturation as well as incidence of VA complications.",Andrea Remuzzi and Simone Manini,10.5301/jva.5000241,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.5301/jva.5000241,The Journal of Vascular Access,,7_suppl,64–69,Computational Model for Prediction of Fistula Outcome,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.5301/jva.5000241,15,2014i
article,doi:10.1177/1046878119872797,"Background. Learning programming is a cognitively demanding field of study accompanied with various difficulties. Although there is a high demand in the market for programmers, software analysts and engineers, a high dropout rate is recorded in relevant fields of study. Serious games are a promising means of engaging students in learning programming by giving them more incentives and making the process of learning programming concepts and languages more entertaining. Aim. This article introduces a new serious game called PY-RATE ADVENTURES, which aims to assist young students in their introduction to the basic programming concepts using Python. The game does not have any prerequisites and is suitable for players with no previous knowledge of programming. This article aims to present important information regarding the analysis, design and pilot evaluation of PY-RATE ADVENTURES. Method. The game was evaluated by 31 people that had recently graduated or were students of an Interdepartmental Programme of Postgraduate Studies in Information Systems. The participants voluntarily played the game and answered a questionnaire based on the MEEGA+ model, after their hands on experience with the game. This questionnaire’s purpose was to evaluate PY-RATE ADVENTURES in terms of perceived player experience and short-term learning. Results. The participants positively evaluated the game almost in all the elements of player experience. Furthermore, the majority of the users consider that the game helped them to learn basic programming concepts in Python and stated that they would prefer to learn programming with this game rather than other teaching methods. Conclusion. The positive results of the pilot evaluation give us the motivation to proceed and evaluate the game with students in secondary education, in order to extract stronger and generalisable conclusions regarding the impact of the game as an educational tool for learning programming concepts.",Grigorios Sideris and Stelios Xinogalos,10.1177/1046878119872797,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1046878119872797,Simulation & Gaming,,6,754–770,PY-RATE ADVENTURES: A 2D Platform Serious Game for Learning the Basic Concepts of Programming With Python,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1046878119872797,50,2019j
