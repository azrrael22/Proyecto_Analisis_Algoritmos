article,doi:10.1177/1094342016649245,"In the last 20 years, a new approach has emerged to investigate the physiopathology of circulation. By merging medical images with validated numerical models, it is possible to support doctors’ decision-making process. The iCardioCloud project aims at establishing a computational framework to perform a complete patient-specific numerical analysis, specially oriented to aortic diseases (like dissections or aneurysms) and to deliver a compelling synthesis. The project can be considered a pioneering example of a Computer Aided Clinical Trial: i.e., a comprehensive analysis of patients where the level of knowledge extracted by traditional measures and statistics is enhanced through the massive use of numerical modeling. From a computer engineering point of view, iCardioCloud faces multiple challenges. First, the number of problems to solve for each patient is significantly huge – this is typical of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) – and it requires parallel methods. In addition, working in a clinical environment demands efficiency as the timeline requires rapid quantitative answers (as may happen in an emergency scenario). It is therefore mandatory to employ high-end parallel systems, such as large clusters or supercomputers. Here we discuss a parallel implementation of an application within the iCardioCloud project, built with a black-box approach – i.e., by assembling and configuring existing packages and libraries and in particular LifeV, a finite element library developed to solve CFD problems. The goal of this paper is to describe the software architecture underlying LifeV and to assess its performance and the most appropriate parallel paradigm. This paper is an extension of a previous work presented at the PBio 2015 Conference. This revision extends the description of the software architecture and discusses several new serial and parallel optimizations to the application. We discuss the introduction of hybrid parallelism in order to mitigate some performance problems previously experienced.",F Auricchio and M Ferretti and A Lefieux and M Musci and A Reali and S Trimarchi and A Veneziani,10.1177/1094342016649245,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1094342016649245,The International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications,,3,351–362,Parallelizing a finite element solver in computational hemodynamics: A black box approach,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1094342016649245,32,2018a
article,doi:10.1177/00222429231221698,"McShane et al.’s (2024) wide-ranging critique of null hypothesis significance testing provides a number of specific suggestions for improved practice in empirical research. This commentary amplifies several of these from the perspective of computational statistics—particularly nonparametrics, resampling/bootstrapping, and Bayesian methods—applied to common research problems. Throughout, the author emphasizes estimation (as opposed to testing) and uncertainty quantification through a comprehensive process of “curating” a variety of graphical and tabular evidence. Specifically, researchers should be encouraged to estimate the quantities that matter, with as few assumptions as possible, in multiple ways, then try to visualize it all, documenting their pathway from data to results for others to follow.",Fred Feinberg,10.1177/00222429231221698,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/00222429231221698,Journal of Marketing,,3,20–28,p-Values as QWERTY: Curating Evidence in the Computational Era,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/00222429231221698,88,2024b
article,doi:10.1177/0037549716675956,"The development of a real-time driving simulator involves highly complex integrated and interdependent subsystems that require a large amount of computational time. When advanced hardware is unavailable for economic reasons, achieving real-time simulation is challenging, and thus delays are inevitable. Moreover, computational delays in the response of driving simulator subsystems reduce the fidelity of the simulation. In this paper, we propose a technique to decrease computational delays in a driving simulator. We used approximation techniques, sensitivity analysis, decomposition, and sampling techniques to develop a surrogate-based vehicle dynamic model (SBVDM). This global surrogate model can be used in place of the conventional vehicle dynamic model to reduce the computational burden while maintaining an acceptable accuracy. Our results showed that the surrogate model can significantly reduce computing costs compared to the computationally expensive conventional model. In addition, the response time of the SBVDM is nearly five times faster than the original simulation codes. Also, as a method to reduce hardware cost, the SBVDM was used and the results showed that most of the responses were accurate and acceptable in relation to longitudinal and lateral dynamics. Based on the results, the authors suggested that the proposed framework could be useful for developing low-cost vehicle simulation systems that require fast computational output.",Nariman Fouladinejad and Nima Fouladinejad and Mohamad Kasim Abdul Jalil and Jamaludin Mohd Taib,10.1177/0037549716675956,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0037549716675956,SIMULATION,,12,1087–1102,Development of a surrogate-based vehicle dynamic model to reduce computational delays in a driving simulator,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0037549716675956,92,2016c
article,doi:10.1177/0261927X20969752,"Politics is an area that is traditionally believed to be gender divided. According to intergroup communication theory, this gender-salient context might cause differences in political communications between genders. Moreover, the internet and social media, which creates a computer-mediated interactive context, might also impact the traditional gender discrepancies in political discourse. This study used Twitter trace-data and computational text analysis to examine such suppositions. By analyzing over one million tweets, we found that compared to men, women generally had a stronger sense of group awareness and cohesion and showed a desire to promote their tweets while avoiding addressing other users in political discussions. Women also focused on family- and home-related issues more than men did. These findings suggest that Twitter is not an ideal public sphere where differences and inequalities are eliminated, but it might be a counter-public sphere that promotes the voices and increases the publicity of marginalized groups.",Lingshu Hu and Michael Wayne Kearney,10.1177/0261927X20969752,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0261927X20969752,Journal of Language and Social Psychology,,4,482–503,Gendered Tweets: Computational Text Analysis of Gender Differences in Political Discussion on Twitter,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0261927X20969752,40,2021d
article,doi:10.1177/1468087417701280,"Mixing and combustion of engine combustion network Spray A after end of injection are modeled using highly resolved multidimensional numerical simulations to explore the physics underlying recent experimental observations of combustion recession. Reacting spray simulations are performed using a traditional Lagrangian–Eulerian coupled formulation for two-phase mixture transport with a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes approach using the open-source computational fluid dynamics code OpenFOAM. Chemical kinetics models for n-dodecane by Cai et al. and Yao et al. are deployed to evaluate the impact of mechanism formulation and low-temperature chemistry on predictions of combustion recession behavior. Simulations with the Cai mechanism show that under standard Spray A conditions, the end-of-injection transient induces second-stage ignition in distinct regions near the nozzle that are initially spatially separated from the lifted diffusion flame, but then rapidly merge with flame. By contrast, the Yao mechanism fails to predict sufficient low-temperature chemistry in mixtures upstream of the diffusion flame during the end-of-injection transient and does not predict combustion recession for the same conditions. The effects of the shape and duration of the end-of-injection transient on the entrainment wave near the nozzle, the likelihood of combustion recession, and the spatiotemporal development of mixing and chemistry in near-nozzle mixtures are also investigated. With a more rapid ramp-down injection profile (ramp-down duration < 400 µs), a weaker combustion recession occurs earlier in time after the start of ramp-down. For extremely fast ramp-down (ramp-down duration = 0), the entrainment flux varies rapidly near the nozzle and over-leaning of the mixture completely suppresses combustion recession. For a slower ramp-down profile with respect to the standard Spray A condition, complete combustion recession back toward the nozzle is observed and combustion recession occurred later in time. Simulations qualitatively agreed with the past experimental and modeling observations of combustion recession with different end-of-injection transients.",Dorrin Jarrahbashi and Sayop Kim and Benjamin W Knox and Caroline L Genzale,10.1177/1468087417701280,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1468087417701280,International Journal of Engine Research,,10,1088–1110,Computational analysis of end-of-injection transients and combustion recession,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1468087417701280,18,2017e
article,doi:10.1177/1538574413503561,"Objectives: To evaluate hemodynamic changes during aneurysmal dilatation in chronic type B aortic dissections compared to hemodynamic parameters in the healthy aorta with the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Methods: True lumen (TL)/false lumen (FL) dimensional changes, changes in total pressure (TP), and wall shear stress (WSS) were evaluated at follow-up (FU) compared to initial examination (IE) with transient CFD simulation with geometries derived from clinical image data and inflow boundary conditions from magnetic resonance images. The TL/FL pressure gradient between ascending and descending aorta (DAo) and maximum WSS at the site of largest dilatation was compared to values for the healthy aorta. Results: Hemodynamic changes at site of largest FL dilatation included 77% WSS reduction and 69% TP reduction. Compared to the healthy aorta, pressure gradient between ascending and DAo was a factor of 1.4 higher in the TL and a factor of 1.5 in the FL and increased at FU (1.6 and 1.7, respectively). Maximum WSS at the site of largest dilatation was a factor of 3 lower than that for the healthy aorta at IE and decreased by more than a factor of 2 at FU. Conclusions: The FL dilatation at FU favorably reduced TP. In contrast, unfavorable increase in pressure gradient between ascending and DAo was observed with higher values than in the healthy aorta. Maximum WSS was reduced at the site of largest dilation compared to healthy aorta.",Christof Karmonik and Matthias Müller-Eschner and Sasan Partovi and Philipp Geisbüsch and Maria-Katharina Ganten and Jean Bismuth and Mark G.

article,doi:10.1177/2053951720949571,"This article introduces an interpretative approach to the analysis of situations in computational settings called situational analytics. I outline the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of this approach, which is still under development, and show how it can be used to surface situations from large data sets derived from online platforms such as YouTube. Situational analytics extends to computationally-mediated settings a qualitative methodology developed by Adele Clarke, Situational Analysis (2005), which uses data mapping to detect heterogeneous entities in fieldwork data to determine ‘what makes a difference’ in a situation. Situational analytics scales up this methodology to analyse situations latent in computational data sets with semi-automated methods of textual and visual analysis. I discuss how this approach deviates from recent analyses of situations in computational social science, and argue that Clarke’s framework renders tractable a fundamental methodological problem that arises in this area of research: while social researchers turn to computational settings in order to analyse social life, the social processes unfolding in these envirnoments are fundamentally affected by the computational architectures in which they occur. Situational analytics offers a way to address this problematic by making a heterogeneously composed situation – involving social, technical and media elements – the unit of computational analysis. To conclude, I show how situational analytics can be applied in a case study of YouTube videos featuring intelligent vehicles and discuss how situational analysis itself needs to be elaborated if we are to come to terms with computational transformations of the situational fabric of social life.",Noortje Marres,10.1177/2053951720949571,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/2053951720949571,Big Data & Society,,2,2053951720949571,For a situational analytics: An interpretative methodology for the study of situations in computational settings,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/2053951720949571,7,2020g
article,doi:10.1177/0957456516655224,"Ever-rising fuel costs necessitate design of fuel-efficient vehicles. Consequently, modern vehicle manufacturers are focused on designing low aerodynamic drag vehicles which would in-turn reduce the fuel consumption. This study analyses the contribution of external rear-view mirrors to the total drag force and the overall sound pressure level at the A, B and C pillars, while optimising the external rear-view mirror design accordingly. Solid Works renditions of external rear-view mirror models mounted on a reference luxury sedan were analysed using a commercially available computational fluid dynamic package ANSYS FLUENT. A different approach was followed to carry out the empirical flow visualisation and predict sound pressure levels. The aerodynamic characterisation of the vehicle was done utilising the widely used shear stress transport turbulence model, while the analysis of wind noise and the contributing vortices employed a large eddy simulation. This approach significantly reduced computational time without compromising on accuracy.",Yagnavalkya Mukkamala and Sandeep Devabhaktuni and Vishnu Ganesh Rajkumar,10.1177/0957456516655224,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0957456516655224,Noise & Vibration Worldwide,,1–2,7–16,Computational aero-acoustic modelling of external rear-view mirrors on a mid-sized Sedan,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0957456516655224,47,2016h
article,doi:10.5772/50932,"Conflict management is one of the most important issues in leveraging organizational competitiveness. However, traditional social scientists built theories or models in this area which were mostly expressed in words and diagrams are insufficient. Social science research based on computational modeling and simulation is beginning to augment traditional theory building. Simulation provides a method for people to try their actions out in a way that is cost effective, faster, appropriate, flexible, and ethical. In this paper, a computational simulation model for conflict management in team building is presented. The model is designed and used to explore the individual performances related to the combination of individuals who have a range of conflict handling styles, under various types of resources and policies. The model is developed based on agent-based modeling method. Each of the agents has one of the five conflict handling styles: accommodation, compromise, competition, contingency, and learning. There are three types of scenarios: normal, convex, and concave. There are two types of policies: no policy, and a reward and punishment policy. Results from running the model are also presented. The simulation has led us to derive two implications concerning conflict management. First, a concave type of resource promotes competition, while convex type of resource promotes compromise and collaboration. Second, the performance ranking of different styles can be influenced by introducing different policies. On the other hand, it is possible for us to promote certain style by introducing different policies.",W. M. Wang and S. L.

article,doi:10.1177/1029864918757595,"In musicology, there has been a long debate about a meaningful partitioning and description of music history regarding composition styles. Particularly, concepts of historical periods have been criticized since they cannot account for the continuous and interwoven evolution of style. To systematically study this evolution, large corpora are necessary suggesting the use of computational strategies. This article presents such strategies and experiments relying on a dataset of 2000 audio recordings, which cover more than 300 years of music history. From the recordings, we extract different tonal features. We propose a method to visualize these features over the course of history using evolution curves. With the curves, we re-trace hypotheses concerning the evolution of chord transitions, intervals, and tonal complexity. Furthermore, we perform unsupervised clustering of recordings across composition years, individual pieces, and composers. In these studies, we found independent evidence of historical periods that broadly agrees with traditional views as well as recent data-driven experiments. This shows that computational experiments can provide novel insights into the evolution of styles.",Christof Weiß and Matthias Mauch and Simon Dixon and Meinard Müller,10.1177/1029864918757595,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1029864918757595,Musicae Scientiae,,4,486–507,Investigating style evolution of Western classical music: A computational approach,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1029864918757595,23,2019j
