article,doi:10.1243/1350650981542236,"Abstract This paper demonstrates the suitability of using computational fluid dynamics software for solving steady state hydrodynamic lubrication problems pertaining to slider bearings, step bearings, journal bearings and squeeze-film dampers under conditions of constant unidirectional or rotating loading. The relevance of the inertia and viscous terms which are neglected in the derivation of the Reynolds equation are briefly investigated for the above bearing and damper configurations and it is shown that the neglected viscous terms have negligible effect whereas the inertia effect predictions agree reasonably well with those reported in the literature.",P.

article,doi:10.1177/0894439320914505,"Anxiety is a pervasive emotional state that tends to arise in situations involving uncertainty due partly to social and contextual issues including competition, economic disparity, and social insecurity. Thus, distribution of aggregate emotions, such as in anxiety, may reveal an important picture of otherwise invisible social processes in which individuals interact with local and global opportunities, constraints, and potential threats. The aim of this study is to present a computational approach to the dynamic distribution of anxiety extracted from natural language expressions of users of Twitter, a popular global social media platform. We develop an unsupervised machine learning procedure based on a naive Bayes model to classify contents of anxiety, estimate the degree of anxiety, and construct a geographic map of spatiotemporal distribution of anxiety. To validate our mapping results, a multilevel statistical analysis was performed to examine how anxiety distribution is correlated with other district-level sociodemographic statistics such as rates of birth and early divorce. Implications for further research and extension are discussed.",Yong Suk Choi and Hansung Kim and Dongyoung Sohn,10.1177/0894439320914505,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0894439320914505,Social Science Computer Review,,3,598‚Äì617,Mapping Social Distress: A Computational Approach to Spatiotemporal Distribution of Anxiety,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0894439320914505,40,2022b
article,doi:10.1177/1046878117748175,"Background. Educational games are nowadays used for facilitating the teaching and learning process of various subjects. History is one of the subjects that simulations and games are used for promoting active learning and supporting students in comprehending various history-related subjects. Aim. This article reports on a new educational game on Greek mythology, called MYTH TROUBLES, designed and developed from scratch with the aim of supporting primary school students in studying Greek mythology and raising their interest on the subject of history. Method. The article presents the educational rationale and design of MYTH TROUBLES in the context of an educational games design model proposed in the literature. Since the game was implemented with the platform of Scratch and it is available online both for students (or anyone interested in Greek Mythology) and game developers, some information for its implementation is also provided. The results of a pilot evaluation of MYTH TROUBLES with the help of 21 experienced school teachers are presented, along with proposals for improvement and extension of the game. Results. Teachers evaluated positively MYTH TROUBLES in terms of acceptability, usability, utility as an educational tool, as well as its interface and game play and expressed their willingness to use it in the classroom. Conclusions. MYTH TROUBLES is considered appropriate by teachers for supporting the teaching and learning of Greek mythology and assessing its educational value in class is the next step. Scratch is appropriate for implementing such educational games and sharing them with interested players and game developers.",Olympia Evangelopoulou and Stelios Xinogalos,10.1177/1046878117748175,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1046878117748175,Simulation & Gaming,,1,71‚Äì91,MYTH TROUBLES: An Open-Source Educational Game in Scratch for Greek Mythology,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1046878117748175,49,2018c

Designing the original tools with the assistance of educational-use environment for computational fluid dynamics programming improves the capability of the students to estimate the flows around architectures based on the mathematical background and the actual program. The authors have developed Educational Library for Fluid as an educational-use environment for computational fluid dynamics programming and ran the workshop where the students majoring in computer-aided architectural design tried to design computational fluid dynamics tools with Educational Library for Fluid.

article,doi:10.1260/147807707783600771,"In historic design conventions geometry has traditionally promoted descriptive manifestations of form. Beyond the realm of geometry, the concept of performance which may inform such manifestations also carries important potential for design generation. This work explores the relation between geometry and performance from a computational-geometry perspective. It does so by revisiting certain analytical tools offered in most of today‚Äôs 3-D modelers which support the evaluation of any generated surface geometry specifically curvature and draft angle analysis. It is demonstrated that these tools can be reconstructed with added functionality assigning 3-D geometrical features informed by structural and environmental performance respectively. In the examples illustrated surface thickness (as a function of structural performance) is assigned to curvature values, and transparency (as a function of light performance) is assigned to light analysis values. In a broader scope this work promotes a methodology of performance-informed form generation by means of computational geometry. Vector and tensor math was exploited to reconstruct existing analytical tools adapted to function as design generators.",Neri Oxman,10.1260/147807707783600771,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1260/147807707783600771,International Journal of Architectural Computing,,4,663‚Äì684,Get Real towards Performance-Driven Computational Geometry,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1260/147807707783600771,5,2007f

article,doi:10.1177/00491241221122596,"This article presents a computational approach to examining immigrant incorporation through shifts in the social ‚Äúmainstream.‚Äù Analyzing a historical corpus of American etiquette books, texts from 1922‚Äì2017 describing social norms, we identify mainstream shifts related to long-standing groups which once were and may currently still be seen as immigrant outsiders in the United States: Catholic, Chinese, Irish, Italian, Jewish, Mexican, and Muslim groups. The analysis takes a computational grounded theory approach, combining qualitative readings and computational text analyses. Using word embeddings, we operationalize the chosen groups as focal group concepts. We extract sections of text that are salient to the focal group concepts to create group-specific text corpora. Two computational approaches make it possible to examine mainstream shifts in these corpora. First, we use sentiment analysis to observe the positive sentiment in each corpus and its change over time. Second, we observe changes in each corpus‚Äôs position on a semantic dimension represented by the poles of ‚Äústrange‚Äù and ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù The results indicate mainstream shifts through increases in positive sentiment and movement from strange to normal over time for most of the group-specific corpora.

article,doi:10.1177/026119290903700509,"For over a decade, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has been engaged in the applied research, development, and evaluation of computational toxicology methods used to support the safety evaluation of a diverse set of regulated products. The basis for evaluating computational toxicology methods is multi-factorial, including the potential for increased efficiency, reduction in the numbers of animals used, lower costs, and the need to explore emerging technologies that support the goals of the US FDA‚Äôs Critical Path Initiative (e.g. to make decision support information available early in the drug review process). The US FDA‚Äôs efforts have been facilitated by agency-approved data-sharing agreements between government and commercial software developers. This commentary review describes former and current scientific initiatives at the agency, in the area of computational toxicology methods. In particular, toxicology-based QSAR models, ToxML databases and knowledgebases will be addressed. Notably, many of the computational toxicology tools available are commercial products ‚Äî however, several are emerging as non-commercial products, which are freely-available to the public, and which will facilitate the understanding of how these programs work and avoid the ‚Äúblack box‚Äù paradigm. Through productive collaborations, the US FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, and the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, have worked together to evaluate, develop and apply these methods to chemical toxicity endpoints of regulatory interest.",Chihae Yang and Luis G.

article,doi:10.1177/0959354317722867,"Two options fuel the debate on the cognitive processes underlying the perception of affordances. On the one hand, the ecological theory of affordance fits with the methodological assumptions of the dynamical systems theory of cognition. On the other hand, it is nowadays common to conceive the perception of affordances within a computational framework. This article defends the explanatory power of a computational approach and aims to extend the concept of affordance beyond the boundaries of the dynamical systems theory of cognition. For that purpose, I consider the case of patients suffering from optic ataxia, a condition in which some aspects of visual guidance over reaching with the hand are lost following a lesion in the left parietal cortex. Etiological considerations, indeed, reveal that a computational approach to the perception of affordances allows for an explanation of ataxic behavior that is not available to the dynamical systems theory.",Silvano Zipoli Caiani,10.1177/0959354317722867,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0959354317722867,Theory & Psychology,,5,663‚Äì682,When the affordances disappear: Dynamical and computational explanations of optic ataxia,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0959354317722867,27,2017j
