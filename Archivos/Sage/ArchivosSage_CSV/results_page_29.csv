This paper bridges the gap based on the skills needed to survive and provide possible solutions to challenges faced by information professionals, which will in turn help to reduce the number of unemployed, semi-employed, non-employed, and provide economic empowerment among information professionals in this new revolution. Information professionals should adopt the missing middle model/techniques in organization which asserts that robots, by and large, will not be taking our jobs; instead, human Machine collaboration will reconfigure some of our work, making and make human skills more unique and important than ever.",Lateef Ayinde and Hal Kirkwood,10.1177/0266382120968057,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0266382120968057,Business Information Review,,4,142–153,Rethinking the roles and skills of information professionals in the 4th Industrial Revolution,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0266382120968057,37,2020a
article,doi:10.1177/089443902237317,"There has been significant recent interest in Agent Based Modeling in many social sciences including economics, sociology, anthropology, political science, and game theory. This article describes three problems that need to be addressed in order for such models to become effective tools for formulating new social theory and informing policy debates and suggests approaches to meeting them. These issues are computational epistemology, research methodology, and software technology. These innovations augment Agent Based Modeling to create an effective new tool base to help better understand complex social systems.",Steven Bankes and Robert Lempert and Steven Popper,10.1177/089443902237317,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/089443902237317,Social Science Computer Review,,4,377–388,"Making Computational Social Science Effective: Epistemology, Methodology, and Technology",https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/089443902237317,20,2002b
article,doi:10.1080/02103702.2019.1604022,"The purpose of the present study was to examine the structure and development of algebraic thinking across multiple dimensions. An algebraic thinking test was administered to 803 students aged 10–13 years old. One hundred and one students of different performance outcomes in the algebraic thinking test participated in semi-structured clinical interviews in order to develop further insights into students’ strategies and difficulties. The results confirmed the multifaceted nature of algebraic thinking and showed that algebraic thinking consists of three aspects: reasoning about covariation, generalization of arithmetic properties and abilities directly related to algebraic syntax. Each one of these aspects is composed of specific algebraic thinking abilities, such as modelling relations using algebraic symbols. Four groups of students of different algebraic thinking profiles were identified: ‘pre-algebraic’, ‘protoalgebraic-procedural’, ‘relational-symbolic algebraic thinking’ and ‘structural-global algebraic thinking’. The results also supported the presence of a consistent trend in the difficulty level across the algebraic thinking abilities, which suggests a specific developmental trend from a more procedural perspective of algebraic thinking to a more structural one.",Marilena-Barbara Chrysostomou and Constantinos Christou,10.1080/02103702.2019.1604022,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1080/02103702.2019.1604022,Journal for the Study of Education and Development,,3,721–781,Analysing the notion of algebraic thinking based on empirical evidence / Un análisis del concepto de pensamiento algebraico basado en evidencia empírica,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1080/02103702.2019.1604022,42,2019c

In order to eliminate the burden of considering all multidimensional design aspects at the same time, this research presents a three-bodied computational method for locating the spaces of the given architectural design program in a project site, according to the defined list of design objectives and criteria. Besides the determination of the layout according to the requirements of the spatial elements, this research proposes an integration of the space syntax theory’s analytical compounds in terms of Justified Graph Analysis and Integration Values as the fitness criteria for the multi-objective evolutionary optimization in the computational model.

article,doi:10.1177/0018720819829949,"Objective: We developed a computational model of the effects of sleep deprivation on the vigilance decrement by employing the methods of system dynamics modeling. Background: Situations that require sustained attention for a prolonged duration can cause a decline in cognitive performance, the so-called vigilance decrement. One factor that should influence the vigilance decrement is fatigue in the form of sleep deprivation. Method: We employed the methods of system dynamics modeling (numerical-integration techniques for modeling complex feedback systems) to create a computational model of the vigilance decrement. We then simulated the computational effects of sleep deprivation on the behavior of that model, using empirical data obtained from the literature for calibrating such effects. Results: Sleep deprivation of 2 hr over a 14-day period should produce an additional decline of 9% in detection performance over that found with the typical vigilance decrement, whereas 4 hr of sleep deprivation over 14 days should produce an additional decline of 14% in detection performance. Conclusion: With respect to dual-process theory, it is through its deleterious effects on analytical cognition that sleep deprivation should impact the vigilance decrement. Application: Such computational modeling may be advantageous for human-machine teaming by theoretically allowing a future autonomous software agent to anticipate the decline of human performance and compensate accordingly.",Robert Earl Patterson and Darrell Lochtefeld and Kathleen G.

article,doi:10.1177/14614448221122212,"Digital trace data and computational methods are increasingly being used by researchers to study mental health phenomena (i.e. psychopathology and well-being) in social media. Computer-assisted mental health research is not simply a continuation of previous studies, but rather raises ethical, conceptual and methodological issues that are critical to behavioural science but have not yet been systematically explored. Based on a systematic review of n = 147 studies, we reveal a multidisciplinary field of research that has grown immensely since 2010, spanning the humanities, social sciences, and engineering. We find that a substantial majority of studies in our sample lack a standardized form of ethical consideration, focus on specific constructs and have a rather narrow focus on specific social media platforms. Based on our findings, we discuss how computational elements have influenced mental health research, highlight academic gaps and suggest promising directions for future studies.",Max Schindler and Emese Domahidi,10.1177/14614448221122212,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/14614448221122212,New Media & Society,,10,2781–2799,The computational turn in online mental health research: A systematic review,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/14614448221122212,25,2023i
article,doi:10.1177/1046878119872797,"Background. Learning programming is a cognitively demanding field of study accompanied with various difficulties. Although there is a high demand in the market for programmers, software analysts and engineers, a high dropout rate is recorded in relevant fields of study. Serious games are a promising means of engaging students in learning programming by giving them more incentives and making the process of learning programming concepts and languages more entertaining. Aim. This article introduces a new serious game called PY-RATE ADVENTURES, which aims to assist young students in their introduction to the basic programming concepts using Python. The game does not have any prerequisites and is suitable for players with no previous knowledge of programming. This article aims to present important information regarding the analysis, design and pilot evaluation of PY-RATE ADVENTURES. Method. The game was evaluated by 31 people that had recently graduated or were students of an Interdepartmental Programme of Postgraduate Studies in Information Systems. The participants voluntarily played the game and answered a questionnaire based on the MEEGA+ model, after their hands on experience with the game. This questionnaire’s purpose was to evaluate PY-RATE ADVENTURES in terms of perceived player experience and short-term learning. Results. The participants positively evaluated the game almost in all the elements of player experience. Furthermore, the majority of the users consider that the game helped them to learn basic programming concepts in Python and stated that they would prefer to learn programming with this game rather than other teaching methods. Conclusion. The positive results of the pilot evaluation give us the motivation to proceed and evaluate the game with students in secondary education, in order to extract stronger and generalisable conclusions regarding the impact of the game as an educational tool for learning programming concepts.",Grigorios Sideris and Stelios Xinogalos,10.1177/1046878119872797,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1046878119872797,Simulation & Gaming,,6,754–770,PY-RATE ADVENTURES: A 2D Platform Serious Game for Learning the Basic Concepts of Programming With Python,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1046878119872797,50,2019j
