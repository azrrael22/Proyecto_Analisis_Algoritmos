article,doi:10.1177/0735633119845694,"This study aims to investigate problem-solving with dataset (PSWD) as a computational thinking learning implementation as reflected in academic publications. Specifically, the purpose is to specify the scope of PSWD, which overlaps with the data literacy, thinking with data, big data literacy, and data-based thinking concepts in the literature. Subaims of the study are to identify the conceptual structure of PSWD based on definitions in academic publications and to classify the reasons given in the literature to show the need for PSWD. For the purposes to investigate PSWD conceptually, to classify the reasons given for the need for PSWD, the obtained 54 publications were analyzed via content analysis. Moreover, this study investigates the most frequently suggested or used teaching strategies (in terms of instructional methods, instructional tools, and grade level) for PSWD in the literature. The frequencies of used words in selected publications referring instructional methods, instructional tools, and grade levels were shown in the findings of study. The importance of the study stems from its focus on a new approach to computational thinking instructional implementation.",Burcu Berikan and Selçuk Özdemir,10.1177/0735633119845694,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0735633119845694,Journal of Educational Computing Research,2,502–534,Investigating “Problem-Solving With Datasets” as an Implementation of Computational Thinking: A Literature Review,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0735633119845694,58,2020a
article,doi:10.3102/0034654317710096,"Computational thinking (CT) uses concepts that are essential to computing and information science to solve problems, design and evaluate complex systems, and understand human reasoning and behavior. This way of thinking has important implications in computer sciences as well as in almost every other field. Therefore, we contend that CT should be taught in elementary schools and included in every university’s educational curriculum. Several studies that measure the impact of teaching programming, analytical thinking, and CT have been conducted. In this review, we analyze and discuss findings from these studies and highlight the importance of learning programming with a focus on the development of CT skills at a young age. We also describe the tools that are available to improve the teaching of CT and provide a state-of-the-art overview of how programming is being taught at schools and universities in Colombia and around the world.",Francisco Buitrago Flórez and Rubby Casallas and Marcela Hernández and Alejandro Reyes and Silvia Restrepo and Giovanna Danies,10.3102/0034654317710096,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.3102/0034654317710096,Review of Educational Research,4,834–860,Changing a Generation’s Way of Thinking: Teaching Computational Thinking Through Programming,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.3102/0034654317710096,87,2017b
article,doi:10.1177/07356331211037757,"Computational thinking (CT) has attracted significant interest among many educators around the globe. Despite this growing interest, research on CT and programming education in elementary school remains at an initial stage. Many relevant studies have adopted only one type of method to assess students’ CT, which may lead to an incomplete view of student development on CT, while other studies employed small sample sizes, which may increase the chance of assuming a false premise to be true. Moreover, conventional programming courses typically have two limitations (e.g., limited student active learning and student low engagement). Given these gaps, this study investigates the effects of a theory-based (5E framework) flipped classroom model (FCM) on elementary school students’ understanding of CT concepts, computational problem-solving performance, and perceptions of flipped learning. To achieve this, a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study was conducted in a rural elementary school, including 125 students in the experimental group and 122 students in the control group. The results showed that the 5E-based FCM significantly improved student understanding of CT concepts and computational problem-solving abilities. The results also revealed positive student perception toward the FCM. The benefits and challenges of the 5E-based FCM are discussed.",Xuemin Gao and Khe Foon Hew,10.1177/07356331211037757,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/07356331211037757,Journal of Educational Computing Research,2,512–543,Toward a 5E-Based Flipped Classroom Model for Teaching Computational Thinking in Elementary School: Effects on Student Computational Thinking and Problem-Solving Performance,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/07356331211037757,60,2022c

What is computational thinking? Why did this article resonate with so many and serve as a rallying cry for educators, education researchers, and policy makers? How have they interpreted Wing’s definition, and what advances have been made since Wing’s article was published? This article frames the current state of discourse on computational thinking in K–12 education by examining mostly recently published academic literature that uses Wing’s article as a springboard, identifies gaps in research, and articulates priorities for future inquiries.",Shuchi Grover and Roy Pea,10.3102/0013189X12463051,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.3102/0013189X12463051,Educational Researcher,1,38–43,Computational Thinking in K–12: A Review of the State of the Field,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.3102/0013189X12463051,42,2013d

While initial implementations focused on skills and knowledge for college and career readiness, more recent framings include situated computational thinking (identity, participation, creative expression) and critical computational thinking (political and ethical impacts of computing, justice). This expansion reflects a revaluation of what it means for learners to be computationally-literate in the 21st century.

article,doi:10.1177/0735633120964402,"In this research, a scale was developed to determine the programming-oriented computational thinking skills of university students. The participants were 360 students studying in various departments at different universities in Turkey for computer programming. The scale consists of 33 items under conceptual knowledge, algorithmic thinking, and evaluation subscale. While there was no significant difference between the students’ conceptual knowledge and algorithmic thinking skills, the evaluation skills of male students differed significantly compared to females. Programming experience has a significant effect on conceptual knowledge, algorithmic thinking, and evaluation. The algorithmic thinking skills of the students who have low, middle, and high-level programming experience differed significantly. In terms of the development of conceptual knowledge and evaluation skills, it was observed that students should have at least one year of programming experience, but this experience will not make a significant difference if it is four years or more. It is thought that this scale, which is structured for different applications (e.g., web, game, robot) and learning environments (e.g., text, block) within the framework of its programming capabilities (conceptual, semantic, strategic knowledge), will contribute significantly to the evaluation of computational thinking as programming oriented.",Servet Kılıç and Seyfullah Gökoğlu and Mücahit Öztürk,10.1177/0735633120964402,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0735633120964402,Journal of Educational Computing Research,2,257–286,A Valid and Reliable Scale for Developing Programming-Oriented Computational Thinking,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0735633120964402,59,2021f
article,doi:10.1177/18344909211010240,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence have brought attention to computational thinking (CT) in school education worldwide. However, little is known about the development of the literacy of CT in children, mainly because of the lack of proper psychometric assessments. We developed the first psychometrically validated assessment on the literacy of CT of children in Chinese elementary schools, coined as the Computational Thinking Assessment for Chinese Elementary Students (CTA-CES). Items were constructed to reflect key aspects of CT such as abstraction, algorithm thinking, decomposition, evaluation, and pattern recognition. To examine the test reliability and validity, we recruited two samples of 280 third- to sixth-grade students in total. Cronbach’s alpha provided evidence for the reliability of the test scores, item response theory analyses demonstrated psychometric appropriateness, whereas construct validity was verified by convergent validity, and criterion-related validity was confirmed by correlations between the CTA-CES and measures related to CT, namely reasoning, spatial ability, and verbal ability. In addition, an fMRI study further demonstrated similar neural activation patterns when students conducted the CTA-CES and programming tasks. Taken together, the CTA-CES is the first reliable and valid instrument for measuring the literacy of CT for Chinese children, and may be applicable to children worldwide.",Yan Li and Shan Xu and Jia Liu,10.1177/18344909211010240,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/18344909211010240,Journal of Pacific Rim Psychology, ,18344909211010240,Development and Validation of Computational Thinking Assessment of Chinese Elementary School Students,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/18344909211010240,15,2021g
article,doi:10.1177/07356331231178948,"Computational thinking (CT) education has drawn increasing attention from educators and researchers. This study conducted a meta-analysis of 27 empirical studies to examine the effectiveness of game-based learning (GBL) for fostering students’ CT. The effects of various factors on the learning process for acquiring CT were also examined. The results showed that (a) conducting GBL can foster students’ CT, and the overall effect was at the upper-middle level (Hedges’ g = .600, 95% CI [.465, .735], p < .001). (b) Furthermore, conducting GBL can improve students’ CT concepts (Hedges’ g = .916, 95% CI [.410, 1.423], p < .001), CT skills (Hedges’ g = .494, 95% CI [.389, .600], p < .001), and CT perspectives (Hedges’ g = .927, 95% CI [.039, 1.816], p < .05). (c) Additionally, game mode, teaching context, and participant characteristics have positive effects on CT. Based on the findings, it is suggested that using more unplugged games and video games, designing collaborative game activities, and tailoring approaches according to gender difference and programming experience can effectively promote CT. The results have significance for fostering students’ CT in GBL; it is further suggested that instruction processes be rationally designed.",Jingsi Ma and Yi Zhang and Zhifang Zhu and Sunan Zhao and Qiyun Wang,10.1177/07356331231178948,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/07356331231178948,Journal of Educational Computing Research,7,1430–1463,Game-Based Learning for Students’ Computational Thinking: A Meta-Analysis,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/07356331231178948,61,2023h

Prior research has shown numerous interdisciplinary benefits related to CT, however, these influential factors have often been investigated with relatively few variables. This study investigated factors that may lead to 4th and 5th grade elementary school students’ development of computational thinking skills in collaborative robotics activities by hypothesizing a model which proposed that a problem solving inventory, intrinsic motivation, and enjoyment were the main predictors of computational thinking skills. The model was then tested by surveying students with several psychometric inventories where a revised model was then constructed. The study found significant relationships between perceived competence and enjoyment, and learning motivation, and intrinsic motivation. Another important finding was that problem solving was a significant predictor of computational thinking skills.
