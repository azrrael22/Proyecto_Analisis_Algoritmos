article,doi:10.1177/0306419015591325,"The teaching of computational fluid dynamics at the undergraduate level usually focuses on giving students an understanding of the numerical methods and details involved, supported by what are little more than code fragments, followed by learning an abstract form of computational fluid dynamics skills and processes, without any real interaction with the complex core computer coding behind what is often just ‘easy-to-use’ or ‘push button’ commercial interfaces. Quite often, as the student progresses in his/her use of computational fluid dynamics, especially in the research area, it becomes clear that an ‘off-the-shelf’ commercial computational fluid dynamics package is not able to satisfy all requirements to simulate a given problem fully, nor to obtain accurate results. The purpose of this paper is to outline what must be taught to add computer coding to what usually is a well-protected, though capable of being compiled and linked, core computer code so that the complexity of interacting is lessened and better understood.",Desmond Adair and Martin Jaeger,10.1177/0306419015591325,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0306419015591325,International Journal of Mechanical Engineering Education,3,153–167,Incorporating computational fluid dynamics code development into an undergraduate engineering course,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0306419015591325,43,2015a

article,doi:10.1177/1464884917693864,"This article outlines a general epistemological framework of data journalism in the devolved nations of the United Kingdom. By using an original model based on three conceptual lenses – materiality, performativity and reflexivity – this study examines the development of this form of journalism, the challenges it faces and its particularities in the context of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This research, therefore, offers unique insights from semi-structured interviews with data journalists and data editors based at, or working as freelancers for, the mainstream news organisations of these regions. The results suggest that data journalism in these devolved nations displays a distinctive character just as much as it reinforces the norms and rituals of the legacy organisations that pioneered this practice. While various models of data exploitation are tested, regional data journalists creatively circumvent generalised organisational struggles to lay the groundwork for their trade and professional community.",Eddy Borges-Rey,10.1177/1464884917693864,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1464884917693864,Journalism,7,915–932,"Towards an epistemology of data journalism in the devolved nations of the United Kingdom: Changes and continuities in materiality, performativity and reflexivity",https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/1464884917693864,21,2020c

article,doi:10.1177/117762500700100010,"In recent years it has become clear that carcinogenesis is a complex process, both at the molecular and cellular levels. Understanding the origins, growth and spread of cancer, therefore requires an integrated or system-wide approach. Computational systems biology is an emerging sub-discipline in systems biology that utilizes the wealth of data from genomic, proteomic and metabolomic studies to build computer simulations of intra and intercellular processes. Several useful descriptive and predictive models of the origin, growth and spread of cancers have been developed in an effort to better understand the disease and potential therapeutic approaches. In this review we describe and assess the practical and theoretical underpinnings of commonly-used modeling approaches, including ordinary and partial differential equations, petri nets, cellular automata, agent based models and hybrid systems. A number of computer-based formalisms have been implemented to improve the accessibility of the various approaches to researchers whose primary interest lies outside of model development. We discuss several of these and describe how they have led to novel insights into tumor genesis, growth, apoptosis, vascularization and therapy.",Wayne Materi and David S.

article,doi:10.1177/0951629812473007,"Representative democracy translates the preferences of the electorate into policy outcomes. Individual voters do not directly vote on policy; rather, their elected representatives create and establish policy. How well do the institutions of representative democracy translate the preferences of the electorate into policy? Is there any systematic bias in a representative democracy system? After formulating a series of computational models it appears that the degree to which legislative districts are ‘gerrymandered’ with respect to preferences about the policy is a source of policy bias. To illustrate the phenomenon, household income is used as a proxy for voters’ preferences with respect to redistribution. Even when the majority of voters are in favor of redistribution, if districts are constructed with a sufficient level of conservative gerrymandering, the policy outcome under representative democracy will favor far less redistribution than the policy outcome under direct democracy.",Robi Ragan,10.1177/0951629812473007,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0951629812473007,Journal of Theoretical Politics,4,467–491,Institutional sources of policy bias: A computational investigation,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0951629812473007,25,2013g
article,doi:10.3233/AAC-190467,"In informal argument, an essential step is to ask what will “resonate” with a particular audience and hence persuade. Marketers, for example, may recommend a certain colour for a new soda can because it “pops” on Instagram; politicians may “fine-tune” diction for different social demographics. This paper engages the need to strategise for such resonance by offering a method for automating opposition analysis (OA), a technique from semiotics used in marketing and literary analysis to plot objects of interest on oppositional axes. Central to our computational approach is a reframing of texts as proxies for thought and opposition as the product of oscillation in thought in response to those proxies, a model to which the contextual similarity information contained in word embeddings is relevant. We illustrate our approach with an analysis of texts on gun control from ProCon.org, implementing a three-step method to: 1) identify relatively prominent signifiers; 2) rank possible opposition pairs on prominence and contextual similarity scores; and 3) derive plot values for proxies on opposition pair axes. The results are discussed in terms of strategies for informal argument that might be derived by those on each side of gun control.",Cameron Shackell and Laurianne Sitbon,10.3233/AAC-190467,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.3233/AAC-190467,Argument & Computation,3,301–317,Computational opposition analysis using word embeddings: A method for strategising resonant informal argument,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.3233/AAC-190467,10,2019h
article,doi:10.1177/0954407020915104,"The computational aero-acoustic study of an isolated passenger car tire is carried out to understand the effect of dimensions of longitudinal tire grooves and operational parameters (velocity and temperature) on tire noise. The computational fluid dynamics and acoustic models are used to obtain aero-acoustic tire noise at near-field and far-field receivers around the tire and artificial neural networks-based regression are used to study the highly non-linear and interactive causal relationships in the system. Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes based realizable k-epsilon model is used to solve the flow field in the computational domain. The Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings model is used to obtain aero-acoustic tire noise at far-field positions. Spectral analysis is used to convert the output time domain to frequency domain and to obtain A-weighted sound pressure level. Artificial neural network–based response surface regression is conducted to understand casual relationships between A-weighted sound pressure level and control variables (Groove depth, Groove width, Temperature and velocity). Maximum A-weighted sound pressure level is observed in the wake region of the tire model. The interaction study indicates that ∼10% reduction in the aero-acoustic emissions is possible by selecting appropriate combinations of groove width and groove depth. The interaction of velocity with width is found to be most significant with respect to A-weighted sound pressure level at all receivers surrounding the tire. The interaction of operational parameters, that is, velocity and temperature are found to be significant with respect to A-weighted sound pressure level at wake and front receivers. Therefore, the regional speed limits and seasonal temperatures need to be considered while designing the tire to achieve minimum aero-acoustic emissions.",Ghulam Moeen Uddin and Sajawal Gul Niazi and Syed Muhammad Arafat and Muhammad Sajid Kamran and Muhammad Farooq and Nasir Hayat and Sher Afghan Malik and Abe Zeid and Sagar Kamarthi and Sania Saqib et al.,10.1177/0954407020915104,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0954407020915104,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part D: Journal of Automobile Engineering",10–11,2561–2577,Neural networks assisted computational aero-acoustic analysis of an isolated tire,https://doi-org.crai.referencistas.com/10.1177/0954407020915104,234,2020i
article,doi:10.1177/1094342006074857,"Detailed experimental measurements of a compressor (pressure, temperature, speed) are not easily available because of size, cost, and access difficulties. A comprehensive computer model is necessary to obtain pressure-volume diagrams for the compressor. The valve is a key component of a compressor as it determines both the efficiency and reliability of the compressor. The valves operate as a result of pressure differences between the ports and the gas chamber. Undesired vibrations and fatigue fracture of thin valves (0.2 mm steel sheet) have not been well understood and experimental difficulties do not allow a thorough analysis of the causes. Initial investigations and modifications to KIVA-3V showed this code can be used to model both gas and suction valve motion. Since the code was written for internal combustion engines, its adaptation to compressors proved to be a difficult task, particularly because of the orientation and complexity of valves. Extensive modifications were made to model an angularly moving valve system, however as we moved down from engine scale (10 cm) to compressor scale (1 cm), grid resolution became a challenge from time to time. Preliminary results showed that the design of the suction valve and the chamber impacts the pressure difference between the input port and the gas chamber. The higher the piston speed, the lower the pressure of the gas, making it perhaps more plausible to avoid premature valve closings at higher speeds. Even though it is still under investigation, valve location and the orientation of its loose end makes a difference to the pressure, suggesting that new designs may be necessary by manufacturers. Experimental data will be needed to validate our model and verify our observations. Future steps include adding a discharge valve and a fluid-solid interface (FSI) module to the modified KIVA-3V code in order to predict the motion of the valves as a result of their interaction with the chamber gas.",O.
