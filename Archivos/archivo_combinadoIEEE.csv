Currently, there is a strong push to integrate aspects of programming and coding into the classroom environment. However, few if any tools exist that enable real-time formative assessment of in-class programming tasks. The proposed REACT (Real Time Evaluation and Assessment of Computational Thinking) system is a first step toward allowing teachers to see which high-level concepts students have mastered and which ones they are struggling with as students code in real time. REACT supports and facilitates the teaching of 21st century computing skills such as computational thinking [1] in the classroom environment.",1943-6106,978-1-4799-4035-6,10.1109/VLHCC.2014.6883021,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883021,Computational Thinking;Online Assessment;Real Time Assessment;Computational Thinking Pattern;Computational Thinking Pattern Analysis,Real-time systems;Games;Programming profession;Pattern analysis;Educational institutions;Computer science education,,28.0,,16.0,IEEE,28 Aug 2014,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In response to the growing computational intensity of the healthcare industry, biomedical engineering (BME) undergraduate education is starting to emphasize computation and computational thinking. Computational thinking is a way of thinking that uses concepts and methodologies of computing to solve problems in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary subjects. In broader terms, computational thinking is not only associated with using computational tools but also with the thought process of solving a problem by data representation, problem decomposition, and algorithm design. Despite being so important, there is little research work or information available on the development of computational thinking in BME undergraduate students. Our research focuses on how BME undergraduate students develop computational thinking skills while performing group activities related to problem-solving. In order to conduct this study, we incorporate a teaching methodology that prompts computational thinking in a thermodynamics course being taught at a public mid-western university to approximately 120 sophomore students. We observe classroom activities involving analytical problem solving followed by pseudo code generation for computational coding. In order to investigate computational thinking, we collect classroom observations of small groups of students as they come up with a solution to an analytical problem with each other. We complement the observation notes of the classroom activities with follow up semi structured interviews with individual students from five groups.

This mindset channels number-crunching toward an ambition to discover knowledge through logic, models and simulations. Here we show how computational cognitive science can be used to reconstruct and analyse the structure of computational thinking mindsets (forma mentis in Latin) through complex networks. As a case study, we investigate cognitive networks tied to key concepts of computational thinking provided by (i) 159 high school students enrolled in a science curriculum and (ii) 59 researchers in complex systems and simulations. Researchers' reconstructed knowledge highlighted a positive mindset about scientific modelling, semantically framing data and simulations as ways of discovering nature. Students correctly identified different aspects of logic reasoning but perceived ‘computation’ as a distressing, anxiety-eliciting task, framed with math jargon and lacking links to real-world discovery. Students' mindsets around ‘data’, ‘model’ and ‘simulations’ critically revealed no awareness of numerical modelling as a way for understanding the world. Our findings provide evidence of a crippled computational thinking mindset in students, who acquire mathematical skills that are not channelled toward real-world discovery through coding. This unlinked knowledge ends up being perceived as distressing number-crunching expertise with no relevant outcome. The virtuous mindset of researchers reported here indicates that computational thinking can be restored by training students specifically in coding, modelling and simulations in relation to discovering nature.

The integral role that Computational Thinking modalities play in engineering disciplines can serve as an accurate indicator of the student future academic success. Therefore, this study investigated the students' performance in a Computational Thinking course offered at the freshman level to predict student academic success. To achieve this goal, a two-year study of the correlation between the students' accumulative grade point averages and their grades obtained in this course was conducted. The performance of nine hundred and eighty two students in forty sections was assessed over the two-year period. It was concluded that the students' future academic performance is strongly correlated to their Computational Thinking skills assessed at the freshman level. This clearly suggests the viability of using Computational Thinking skills as a fairly accurate predictor of students' academic success.

The students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering showed the practical value of computational thinking in non-IT disciplines, particularly in using specialized software such as MATLAB. For students with foundational knowledge, the learning sequence between learning computational thinking and programming was less significant. However, for beginners or those from non-IT backgrounds, effective learning required the coherence and integration of courses. Thus, it is required to maintain cross-course coherence and establish links between computational thinking and programming skills to offer a more in-depth learning experience.",,979-8-3503-2778-6,10.1109/SSIM59263.2023.10469197,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10469197,computational thinking;programming;learning sequence;course coherence;interdisciplinary application,Training;Systematics;Social sciences;Coherence;Programming;Software;Information management,,,,11.0,IEEE,22 Mar 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Computational thinking is advocated as not only a fundamental skill or concept in computer science but also a core competency for all disciplines. Teaching students in non-computer science majors computing thinking is challenging because students do not have experts' mental models. This study investigates the knowledge gap that non-computing major college students (n=126) possess about computational thinking in an introductory MS Excel course by measuring their performance using spreadsheet functions in three categories: recall, application, and problem solving. The empirical result, analyzed using ANOVA, shows that students can recall the meaning of those functions but seem to have trouble using them correctly and precisely (cued or uncued). Students' test results suggest the following issues: (1) problems with understanding the data type, (2) failure in translating problems to productive representations using spreadsheet functions, and (3) inadequate stipulation of the computational representations in precise forms. Addressing these problems early and explicitly in future classes could improve the education of computational thinking and alleviate difficulties students may experience in using computational thinking in learning and problem solving.",2377-634X,978-1-61284-469-5,10.1109/FIE.2011.6142980,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6142980,Computational Thinking;Computer Science Education;Spreadsheet Functions;Problem Solving,Problem-solving;Computer science;Computers;Conferences;Educational institutions;Instruments,,9.0,,9.0,IEEE,2 Feb 2012,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The Delphi technique was employed to collect different views and derive consensus from a panel of thirteen experts, including computer scientists, computer science educators, K-12 computer teachers, and industry experts. The first draft of Delphi survey questionnaire, consisting of nine themes (problem solving, problem decomposition, algorithms, data representation, data analysis, modeling and simulation, abstraction, automation, and others) and 60 competence indicators, was developed based on our investigation of the nature of computational thinking. After three rounds of survey and a final round-table discussion, the expert panel derived 49 essential competence indicators (13 for grades K to 6, nine for grades 7 to 9 and 27 of grades 10 to 12) and eight optional competence indicators (one for grades 7 to 9 and seven for grades 10 to 12). According to the results, the core ability and training of computational thinking are different in grades. In grades K to 6, students develop logical thinking and problem solving skills in personal and family life. In grades 7 to 9, students must understand the basic concepts of programming and write basic programs. Finally, in grades 10 to 12, they will use high-level skills to apply the concepts of abstraction, modeling, and structured problem decomposition to solve problems in different fields.

It is generally accepted that Programming is a complex task that requires a long learning process. Theoretical knowledge about fundamentals on algorithms and data structures, as well as, on programming languages are required but are not enough; practicing a lot is also necessary. However, teaching Computer Programming is a hard job, most of the times unsuccessful. To overcome all the difficulties, felt by teachers and students, an increasingly bigger community of researchers in Computer Science is defending the importance of teaching Computational Thinking to young students to train them, since very earlier, in logic and abstract reasoning for problem solving. Our starting point to approach this topic relies on the use of an Ontology (OntoCnE) that describes in detail the concepts “Computational Thinking” and “Programming”, and maps those concepts to different education levels, starting with the first year. We believe that a person just acquires a new way of thinking, or a new way of behaving, if he is trained with the appropriate learning resources. So a main investment to educate people in Computational Thinking is on the choice/creation of those convenient resources. In particular we intended to investigate the impact of Augmented Reality in the usefulness of the referred resources. In that direction we will also discuss the development of a Web Platform to help on collecting and classifying (according to the referred ontology) learning resources to be used by teachers in computing classes. On the other hand, the platform will help on the retrieval, from that repository, of the most adequate resources to teach a specific subject to a specific level.",,978-1-7281-3182-5,10.1109/SIIE48397.2019.8970131,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8970131,computational thinking;programming;learning resource;teacher support tools;ontology,,,6.0,,15.0,IEEE,28 Jan 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

However, these environments lack specific support for teaching computational thinking to novices. Typically, such skills are acquired in ad hoc practical sessions with supervision provided by teachers or peers. The usual scenario is where a teacher guides the students in solving these problems during a game design session. In informal learning settings, step-by-step tutorials for creating existing games are used to compensate for the lack of computer support for solving design and computational problems. In this paper we suggest a game design process that combines support for computational thinking with tool usage, by identifying the most common computational thinking problems and providing a generic solution to them.

The key features of CTQ are (1) an interactive storyline with animated avatars, mini-games, and questions created using Unity three-dimensional cross-platform game engine and Blockly block-based visual programming language; (2) questions at three different levels of difficulty for effective adaptive and self-learning approach; (3) an answer and feedback to each question for increased students' confidence and enthusiasm towards learning; (4) hyperlinks to online learning resources for further reading; (5) a badge and a leaderboard to motivate active participation and encourage success; and (6) a course management system with automatic data saving capability to enable learning at own pace, anytime, anywhere. The CTQ was rolled out to some newly matriculated first-year undergraduate Engineering (ENG) and InfoComm Technology (ICT) students. A total of 54 ENG and 53 ICT students' learning performance and feedback were collated and analyzed. Statistical results from the paired Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test consistently reveal that (1) the median of post-test marks is significantly higher than that of pre-test marks (p < 0.001); (2) the median of CT knowledge scores after taking CTQ is significantly higher than that of before CTQ (p < 0.001); and (3) the median time taken to complete the post-test is significantly lower than the pre-test (p < 0.001). Furthermore, more than 75% of ENG and ICT students, separately, stated that CTQ is an engaging or very engaging learning platform; 81% of them indicated that the educational content of CTQ is enriching or very enriching; and 83% of them commented that CTQ has motivated independent learning. The CTQ can also serve as a bridging course to narrow the heterogeneity gap among students with heterogeneous prior knowledge on computer programming languages and ease students into programming-related modules, thereby enhancing teaching and learning effectiveness.",2377-634X,978-1-6654-3851-3,10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637467,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637467,computational thinking;gamification;adaptive learning;independent learning;online education platform,Computer languages;Visualization;Electronic learning;Conferences;Education;Games;Problem-solving,,7.0,,34.0,IEEE,20 Dec 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

However, the vision for computational thinking, laid out by a number of scholars, is even bigger than this. It proposes that thinking habits from computer science are beneficial for any kind of problem solving and that those thinking habits form a central part of modern sciences. It might be that components of computational thinking are indeed useful in problem solving and that they play an important part in other sciences. However, computer science combines three types of thinking traditions: theoretical (mathematical) tradition, engineering tradition and scientific tradition, and it is important to differentiate between what is an aspect in one or more of these traditions and what is unique for computer science.

In the face of this, this work created an augmented reality android application that tracks physical tiles and creates 3D maps for the user, also giving a character that can be programmed to walk on this created map, simulating a programming toy. Finally, tests carried out with the application have shown that augmented reality currently has performance problems when multiple targets are used, so, devices with low processing have problems at map tracking. These issues affected the tests with the children, which made it difficult for them to track the map like they wanted, but they still liked the app even after it. That shows that the acceptance of the technology by the children is good, which can help developing Computational Thinking, but the technology limitation is still a problem.

Can computational thinking reduce marginalization in the future Internet?,P. Wentworth,"Department of Computer Science, Rhodes University, South Africa",2010 ITU-T Kaleidoscope: Beyond the Internet? - Innovations for Future Networks and Services,6 Jan 2011,2010,,,1,5,"Maths is presently regarded as the key driver that underpins Science, Education and Technology (SET) skills. In spite of significant studies, investment and efforts, math skills and widespread enthusiasm for SET remain elusive. In South Africa's disadvantaged communities, poor quality maths teaching and poor maths performance, both legacies of past political engineering, further fuel marginalization. Computational thinking is a new characterization of some specific procedural thinking, abstraction, problem solving and organizational skills that are finding their way from computer science programs into other fields. The paper describes our refocus of content in BingBee, a SET skill-building kiosk project targeting disadvantaged communities. As we shift to emphasize computational thinking more explicitly, we speculate that these skills could complement, and perhaps eventually displace, some elements of maths as the dominant driver of SET. The confluence of better tools, open service interfaces, and the rapid spread of handsets and devices into marginalized communities is an opportunity to build more widespread computational thinking skills. This could in turn facilitate a future Internet which is more inclusive, and in which users are able to create their own services.",,978-1-4244-8272-6,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5682137,Computational thinking;problem solving;abstraction;cognitive skills;marginalized communities,Games;Internet;Computer science;Problem-solving;Educational institutions;Mathematics,,,,10.0,,6 Jan 2011,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Enhancing Confidence in Using Computational Thinking Skills via Playing a Serious Game: A Case Study to Increase Motivation in Learning Computer Programming,C. Kazimoglu,"Faculty of Engineering, Cyprus International University, Nicosia, Cyprus",IEEE Access,17 Dec 2020,2020,8,,221831,221851,"Computer Science (CS) is a profession that positively impacts every single area of society without which today's world would come to a complete halt. Yet, there is a consensus that CS has serious conundrums particularly in attracting students, low motivation for learning computer programming and developing computational thinking (CT) skills. New motivational methods are needed to take the attention of students and adapt to their learning patterns as how people learn have changed drastically over the last two decades. To address these issues, video games and video game-based tools are proposed as a primary approach for motivating and supporting students in developing their skills in CT and support their learning of introductory programming. This research is concerned with the capture of statistical evidence on the educational effectiveness of playing a serious game specifically designed to enhance the development of CT skills to facilitate learning introductory computer programming. A total of 190 students were invited to participate in a quasi-experimental pre-post study for the purpose of analyzing the impact of an adhoc game on students' confidence in learning programming constructs and using their skills in CT. All students were studying a CS degree at the time and they were all registered to a first-year computer programming course. 151 out of 190 students successfully completed the study and the findings suggest that a) the intrinsic motivation to learn programming; b) students' perception of their knowledge and their tangible knowledge in key programming constructs (i.e. programming sequence, methods, decision making and loops); and c) students' confidence in using their CT skills were all statistically and significantly improved after playing the game.

Developing Computational Thinking Skills With Algorithm-Driven Spreadsheeting,M. Csernoch; P. Biró; J.

The novel method applied in the project, entitled Sprego (Spreadsheet Lego), is a concept-based problem-solving approach adapted from the didactics of other sciences and computer programming. In the experimental group contextualized, real-world programming problems are presented in a spreadsheet environment. A semi-unplugged data-driven analysis is carried out based on each problem, which is followed by the building of a feasible algorithm, expressed by natural language expressions. The coding is completed in the following step by applying a limited number of spreadsheet (Sprego) functions, multilevel, and array formulas. The final steps of the process are discussion and debugging. On the other hand, classical, tool-centered approaches are applied in the control groups. Our research reveals that the traditional surface approach methods for teaching spreadsheeting do not provide long lasting, reliable knowledge which would provide students and end-users with effective problem-solving strategies, while Sprego does. Beyond this finding, the project proves that Sprego supports schema construction and extended abstraction, which is one of the major hiatus points of traditional surface navigation methods. The project also reveals that developing computational thinking skills should not be downgraded, and the misconceptions of self-taught end-users and user-friendly applications should be reconsidered, especially their application in educational environments. Gaining effective computer problem-solving skills and knowledge-transfer abilities is not magic, but a time-consuming process which requires consciously developed and effective methods, and teachers who accept the incremental nature of the sciences.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3126757,construction(grant numbers:EFOP-3.6.3-VEKOP-16-2017-00002); European Union through the European Social Fund; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9606871,Algorithm-driven spreadsheeting;long lasting knowledge;schema construction;cognitive load;end-user computing;computational thinking,Programming profession;Education;Problem-solving;Informatics;Mathematics;Task analysis,,4.0,,128.0,CCBY,8 Nov 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

In maker culture, the ability to program along with other technical skills often exceeds this limitation and also includes fun activities through personally fabricated projects. In this paper, we examine computational design projects that are intended to be 3D printed and could potentially introduce coding learning actions. To find computationally rich designs that are appealing to learners, we conducted data analysis on an online makerspace which exploits computational design tools for personal fabrication. We found the most liked designs of the online makerspace and examined which of them included programming features (iterations, conditional statements and functions/modules) and could foster computational thinking elements such as abstract and algorithmic thinking, pattern recognition, and decomposition. The most liked category of designs was Figures (of animals and popular animation characters among other things) which surprisingly often also included programming features.

To foster CT among K-12 students, different initiatives have been introduced by governmental and non-governmental entities, and numerous studies have been carried out by researchers to define and integrate CT into school curriculum. However, previous studies has shown little agreement among researchers, governmental and non-governmental sectors about a unified CT definition. These dissensions have introduced challenges in formulating a definition for CT at the K-12 level. The absence of a unified definition may increase the challenges for teachers to teach and integrate CT into school curriculum. To foster CT among K-12 students, we introduce a definition and framework for CT. We evaluated 39 articles and extracted the most common elements used in the literature to frame CT definition and describe its elements. Several studies have discussed, as well as investigated, the significance of conceptualizing and comprehending the interaction and dependency relationships among computational objects. However, our literature review discovered that little attention has been dedicated to the concept of dependency in the CT body of knowledge. Based on the literature review, we define CT as the thought process used for solving problems, and it encompasses the elements of problem decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking. We conjecture the CT definition is missing the element of dependency. In the context of CT, we define dependency as the knowledge of comprehending the interrelationships between different sections of a decomposed problem.",2165-9567,978-1-6654-4434-7,10.1109/EDUCON52537.2022.9766703,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9766703,Computational Thinking (CT);K-12 Education;Dependency;Abstraction;Decomposition;Algorithmic Thinking,Computer science;Bibliographies;Conferences;Computational modeling;Engineering education,,,,69.0,IEEE,11 May 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Game-based learning assessments (GBLA) are able to assess tacit knowledge by avoiding jargon in test items., constructing irrelevant material., and reducing anxiety., avoiding the barriers of traditional assessments in assessing students' abilities. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT., it is necessary to integrate diverse problem-solving contexts using a digital game-based assessment model to measure CT. We invited 13 experts to participate in three rounds of the Delphi method and constructed a CT skills assessment model based on the digital game. The model had good consistency and was divided into four primary indicators., namely “Analysis”., “Design”., “Iteration”., and “Generalization”., which were weighted as 0.26., 0.11., 0.24., and 0.39., respectively and 14 secondary indicators.

Not only do many undergraduate students lack these ways of thinking, but there is a general misrepresentation of computing in education. Were computing taught as a more serious subject like science and mathematics, public understanding of the complexities of computer systems would increase, enabling those not directly involved with IT make better informed decisions and avoid incidents such as over budget and underperforming systems.

Educational games have been applied by several researchers to address related issues faced for promoting CT. Even though such games have shown some success in promoting CT, they fall short when it comes to acquisition of CT skills (they rather promote abstract and conceptual knowledge) and offering adaptivity to each player. To address these issues and improve the existing games, we developed an adaptive game called AutoThinking for teaching both CT concepts and skills, engaging students with individually tailored gameplay and learning.

This study investigated the cross-lagged association between CT cognitive performance and attitudinal beliefs of primary students through a three-wave longitudinal design. The paper reported the first two waves of data collection, with an 8-month time interval, involving a sample of 392 students (age 9-11). At each wave, students were asked to complete a CT cognitive test and a self-reported attitude survey. Through cross-lagged analyses, the results showed that prior CT cognitive performance significantly predicted later learning attitudes, and the paths remained significant after controlling for students’ demographics and learning experiences. The study contributes to the literature by pioneering documenting the cross-lagged relations between students’ cognitive and attitudinal attainments in the context of CT education.",2470-6698,978-1-6654-9117-4,10.1109/TALE54877.2022.00098,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10148553,computational thinking;coding attitudes;longitudinal study;cross-lagged panel model,Surveys;Attitude control;Computational modeling;Education;Data collection,,1.0,,27.0,IEEE,14 Jun 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The base idea is to use games to help create awareness and generated needed CT skills and abilities; in short, it is “games for CT” approach. This is however, one part of the equation for understanding and developing CT in our modern digital age. The other part of the equation lies in using “CT for games”. This paper addresses this perspective to aid in the understanding and framing of the elusive CT concept. In “CT for games”, this paper highlights and draws attention to using CT for developing games instead of using games to develop CT. The core contributions of the paper are a “CT for games” proposed framework; selected variants of health games and observations of “Rebel Design”.

Additionally, the popularity of GBL has grown in computer science and programming courses, where it can be used to develop computational thinking (CT) skills. CT is critical thinking used to apply fundamental concepts and reasoning derived from computing and computer science. Research has shown that digital GBL can improve critical thinking skills and help learners understand programming concepts, structures, and problem-solving strategies. Despite the popularity of digital GBL, analog card games and bingo games are still valuable and effective tools for learning. However, most studies on GBL that aim to train critical thinking skills have focused on digital approaches. This indicates a gap in the body of knowledge because few studies have explored the effectiveness of analog games for developing CT skills through GBL. The theoretical framework of this study is grounded in two learning theories. Constructivist theory frames learning as the construction of knowledge through a process of action, reflection, and construction. Constructionist learning theory calls for construction of artifacts, learner agency, authentic purpose, or authentic audience during the process. To investigate the design of GBL for developing CT skills and to generate discourse for its widespread adoption, the current study implemented design-based research (DBR) in an undergraduate computer science course for non-computer science majors. By addressing the gap in the literature on GBL for CT skill development, the study aimed to investigate complex learner experiences, including learner struggles and successes, alignment with learning theory principles, and design moves for future iterations of the project. The research question posed is: how can we optimize CT learning through GBL, based on learner experiences and learning theories? Prior to this study, the instructor used GBL in which learners played an analog, three-dimensional tic-tac-toe game with ping pong balls and then wrote a computer program that simulated that game. We chose to conduct DBR to strengthen the learning associated with this activity. DBR uses iterative designs to develop knowledge that improves educational practices. In the spring of 2023, we assessed the extent to which the non-digital game and programming the simulated game enhanced learners' CT skills by analyzing their experiences with CT. This involved collecting and analyzing learner surveys to gain insight into their learning experiences. Using network analysis and betweenness centrality measures, the data will be analyzed to identify learner struggles and successes. The results are expected to be available by August 2023. The contributions of this study include identifying effective design principles for GBL, optimizing CT learning, and generating discourse for the widespread adoption of GBL in computer science education.",2377-634X,979-8-3503-3642-9,10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342931,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342931,game-based learning (GBL);design-based research (DBR);computational thinking;computer science;undergraduate;constructivist;constructionist;analog,Surveys;Education;Digital simulation;Games;Solids;Reflection;Computer science education,,,,30.0,IEEE,5 Jan 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Improving Computational Thinking Competencies in STEM Higher Education,N. Dehbozorgi; M. Roopaei,NA; NA,2024 IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC),17 Sep 2024,2024,,,01,04,"Computational thinking (CT) is a key competency with a significant impact on students' academic performance in STEM fields. It empowers students to enhance problem-solving skills by decomposing problems, utilizing abstraction and pattern recognition, and employing algorithmic thinking to design solutions and build models. This is particularly important in STEM disciplines where logical reasoning is essential for addressing complex real-world challenges in academic and industrial settings. Given the increasing demand for professionals equipped with strong algorithmic thinking and problem-solving abilities in Industry 5, educational institutions are focusing on enhancing students' CT and problem-solving skills. This study presents an initiative conducted over the past two years at our institute to teach CT in a gateway course to students with different backgrounds in STEM fields. The approach involved designing specific learning modules on Abstraction, Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, and Algorithmic Thinking and integrating them into the LMS. After studying these learning modules, the students were exposed to specific assignments that required the application of related CT skills. Pre and post surveys were employed by using standard CT tests to measure the impact of the intervention on students' CT levels. The results indicated an improvement in students' perceptions of their mastery of CT. Academic course grades also showed an improvement, with increased A scores and reduced F grades post-intervention. This two-year study on improving CT skills has yielded promising results. Moving forward, the research aims to enhance the existing modules further and distribute them to a broader range of introductory-level STEM courses in other universities. This future direction aligns with the goal of expanding the impact of CT education and integrating it more widely into STEM curricula.",2473-7623,979-8-3503-5280-1,10.1109/ISEC61299.2024.10664997,Kennesaw State University; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10664997,Computational Thinking;Higher Education;Integrated STEM Education;Student Performance,Surveys;Industries;Computational modeling;Focusing;Logic gates;Cognition;Pattern recognition,,,,12.0,IEEE,17 Sep 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Specifically, our gamified learning system is designed to make learning more fun, engaging, and effective through game and experiment elements that align with science and math learning standards. It will also increase systematic problem-solving and algorithmic reasoning for K-12 students. Since the human body can be thought of as a combination of interacting systems, the game also introduces students to computational thinking by introducing internal body functions. To achieve these goals, this project has two components. First, an educational virtual reality game will be built according to the natural human body structure. During the game process, students will experience the same as the human body functions, travel along the blood circulation, help with the heartbeat, and participate in oxygen exchange. While students are playing the game, our gamified adaptive learning system tracks and controls the student's learning progress. As the AI component collects student data and uses this information, our system adjusts game content and addresses possible learner issues to refine the learning curriculum for a faster and more effective learning experience. Second, a series of hands-on activities will be conducted based on the functions of the human body (e.g., developing an artificial heart and experiencing how the heart works). Through this project, an attractive and efficient next-generation learning system will be developed and used to expose K-12 students to this learning system. The education of students will be accomplished in different dimensions through games and hands-on practice, respectively. Additionally, compared to traditional learning methods, our learning system not only increases students' interest in learning but also makes it more personalized compared to the conventional learning process. Likewise, we will refer to the results of self-efficacy surveys administered to students and teachers separately to test their perceptions of their abilities and the new system.",2377-634X,979-8-3503-3642-9,10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342946,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342946,Gamification;Educational Software;Learning Technology;Computational Thinking;Systematic Thinking,Learning systems;Heart;Systematics;Games;Virtual reality;Cognition;Teamwork,,,,15.0,IEEE,5 Jan 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Contemporary teaching should prepare learners for everyday and working life, suggesting that this can only be achieved by implementing Digital Education from primary education onwards. Since computer science education is planned to be anchored in the Austrian primary school curriculum as an interdisciplinary competence development, research into teaching methods and content suitable for this area is becoming increasingly necessary. In this context, the transfer of innovations and didactic approaches into teaching is one of the biggest challenges. Introducing coding and robotics would be a possible strategy. Educational robotics provide access to real-world scenarios and offer age-appropriate possibilities to explore digital aspects of living and working environments. Combined with narrative methods, such as digital storytelling, problem-solving skills could be developed. Since the implementation of computer science in primary education requires practical and theoretical knowledge, an educational design approach is used that takes this aspect into account and allows close interaction between researchers and practitioners. This paper focuses on investigating a feasible and effective robotics-based learning environment for developing and supporting problem-solving skills at primary school using the learning and teaching method digital storytelling.

Computational thinking has been acknowledged as a key aspect of engineering education and an intrinsic part of multiple ABET outcomes. However, computing is an area where some students have more privileges (e.g. access and exposure to meaningful use of computers) than others. Integrating computing into engineering, especially early in the curriculum, may exacerbate existing experiential disadvantages students from excluded social identities experience. Most introductory engineering programs have a component of programming and/or computational thinking. A comprehensive literature review showed that no existing computational thinking framework fully met the needs of students and professors in engineering and computer science. As a result, this team created the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD). This diagnostic was assessed and improved during the 2019-2020 academic year. Data was collected from a cohort in a first-year engineering course that included topics in mathematics, engineering problem solving, and computation. Pre- and post-test data analysis with 62 participants documents statistically significant student growth in computational thinking in this course. Significant differences were not found by gender or a limited racially-based analysis. This diagnostic is of interest and relevance to all institutions providing engineering and computing programs. The short-term impact of this research includes an innovative approach to gauge student abilities in computational thinking early in a course in order to add appropriate intervention activities into lesson plans.

We provide a program overview of CompuGirls, describe our curricular design approach, and share results from pilot implementations of the program offered at public libraries in Michigan, Arizona, and California. Results from our pilot year demonstrate that integrating identity exploration into a computational thinking curriculum results in a mutually reinforcing relationship where girls of color experience reflective identity development while simultaneously increasing their understanding of computational thinking. We present our approach as a promising avenue for connecting computing knowledge and skills to girls' identities and lived experiences.

In general, learners use visual, block-based programming languages to acquire these skills, with Scratch being one of the most popular ones. Similar to professional developers, learners also copy and paste their code, resulting in duplication. In this paper we present the findings of correlating the assessment of the CT skills of learners with the presence of software clones in over 230,000 projects obtained from the Scratch platform. Specifically, we investigate i) if software cloning is an extended practice in Scratch projects, ii) if the presence of code cloning is independent of the programming mastery of learners, iii) if code cloning can be found more frequently in Scratch projects that require specific skills (as parallelism or logical thinking), and iv) if learners who have the skills to avoid software cloning really do so. The results show that i) software cloning can be commonly found in Scratch projects, that ii) it becomes more frequent as learners work on projects that require advanced skills, that iii) no CT dimension is to be found more related to the absence of software clones than others, and iv) that learners -even if they potentially know how to avoid cloning- still copy and paste frequently.

As higher education institutions, we need to take responsibility for this development in every degree course we offer, and provide students with the kind of subjects and activities that best contribute to this aim. In this paper, we study the impact of following an introductory programming course on the development of the computational thinking capabilities of university students. In order to achieve this aim, a concurrent cohort observational study was carried out in which we measured both the subjective and objective computational thinking capabilities of 104 participants (50 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Psychology at the Catholic University of Murcia (UCAM), and 54 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Health Information Systems at the University of Alicante (UA)). The statistical procedures applied to test our hypotheses were a two-way mixed ANOVA, a paired-sample T-test and an independent-sample T-test. The data shows that the group at UA had an initial higher subjective perception of their computational capabilities than the group at UCAM. This perception was supported by their objective scores, which were also significantly higher. However, the subjective assessment of computational capability of the UA group diminished after exposure to the programming course, contrasting with the fact that their objective computational capabilities improved significantly. In the UCAM group, both subjective and objective capabilities remained constant over time. Based on these results, we can conclude that computational thinking capabilities are not developed naturally, but need to be trained. Providing such training to all our students, and not only to those enrolled on undergraduate degrees in engineering, is of paramount importance to allow them to face the challenges of their future professions.

Diverse studies reveal that the initial decision about the vocation in studies is made towards the end of the primary education stage, also from 8–9 years old. The Digital Transformation Commission of the Engineering Associations of Catalonia is concerned about the low number of young people who decide to pursue STEM studies. STEM explorations in early childhood lay the foundation for lifelong learning. In addition, from age 5, children informally begin to practice proportional reasoning, and in the third year of primary school (8–9 years old), the subject is formally introduced into the Primary Education curriculum. The notion of proportionality is very transversal, and it is one of the fundamental concepts of the STEM field. The consequences of an incomplete understanding of it directly or indirectly affect the attitude of subjects toward mathematics and the STEM world. With the emergence of Industry 4.0, the digital twin concept is becoming one of the central instruments of Digital Transformation. In this paper, we propose using computational thinking to help the understanding of proportional thinking using a physical and digital twin pair. In 2022, computational thinking was introduced into the Spanish and Catalan educational system's early childhood, primary, and secondary education curricula. It includes programming with block languages such as Scratch or Snap!. A digital twin of the system has also been implemented in Snap!. Through the collaboration of a primary school, a workshop has been prepared in which they exercise the concepts of proportional reasoning, such as ratio, proportion, scale, or percentage. The approach followed has consisted of developing a physical system of a floating ball, controlling the electric motor's power with an electronic system based on low-cost elements from the maker world. We have designed a very easy-to-use system for any teacher, and its open-source nature ensures its transparency and documentation. The foam ball rises and remains floating at a height determined by the power supplied to the motor. The control of the system is carried out with Snap!. It will be assumed that the engine revolutions are proportional to the power setpoint. The physical system generates a high level of expectation and attention in the students, facilitating the process of its abstraction. The range of options of the developed system allows experimenting with the actual system and a schematic digital twin with sound effects. In all cases, the same computational thinking tools have been used to exercise the concepts and powerful ideas of proportional reasoning. At the end of the workshop, the understanding of the concepts exercised and the assessment of their personal experience were evaluated.

The Computational Thinking MOOC was designed using a project-based learning approach and aims to provide learners with an introduction to the “big ideas” of computational thinking using a range of case studies that encompass topics such as airport surveillance, epidemiology, and human trafficking. Beyond observing a sharp increase in enrollment and engagement at the time the pandemic began, we discuss ways in which the course's project-based pedagogy allowed learners to bring their present experiences and concerns together with the course's subject matter in order to meet the learning objectives for the course. Many learners chose to address aspects of the pandemic in the course's final project and applied ideas about computational thinking to peer-graded assignments that conveyed an individualized sense of importance and urgency.

The fundamental CT concepts include abstraction, algorithm design, decomposition, pattern recognition, and data representation or generalization. CT assessment is required to improve the understanding of the cognitive abilities and to relate them in related areas, such as introductory programming in computer science. Assessing computational thinking skills however is a challenging issue since it measures latent variables that cannot be directly observed. In addition, according to psychometrics, appropriate test requires a validation process before it can be effectively used as a measuring instrument. Thus, high quality tools for measuring student learning in Introductory Programming have been under-developed and under-researched. The objective of this work is to determine the psychometric properties (item validity, reliability, discrimination, difficulty, and distractors) of the developed multiple-choice questions of computational thinking in introductory programming by exploring classical test theory and item response theory which has not been deeply investigated by previous studies. The analysis results reveal that most of items are valid and the items are generally adequate reliable.

In many of the engineering career programs, the Physics courses are fundamental, and because of the diversity in contexts, they have not been seen as a subject where students can develop the computational thinking process. Present work describes an empirical study based on the learning of the rigid body concept in physics, with the use of spreadsheets as an electronic tool for promoting the learning with the programming of all the dynamical system, describing the evolution, generating, and analyzing graphics, and explaining the physical phenomena with a high comprehension and transfer of knowledge. At the end, students identified where the concept can be applied in their professional context with the use of a simulation. The learning sequence was implemented in three sessions of 1.5 hours each one, two diagnostic tests were applied, one for identifying the previous knowledge and use of electronic spreadsheets, the second one used as a pretest and post-test, it was focused on the main concepts of the rigid body system, like forces, kinematics, and circular movement. The sequence was implemented with N = 77, students. Session 1, started with the introduction of electronic spreadsheets for their use in science and engineering, some examples in Physics and Mathematics were described with their respect feedbacking for students. For session two, the rigid body concept was described with the support of electronic spreadsheets, all the dynamics, equations, plotting of the results and the relationships of all variables were described; for reinforcing the concept learned, students were asked to solve two more similar exercises with the use of the spreadsheets as homework, and finally they were asked to record, in groups of three students, a video with the solution of the problem assigned. In the video, they must present the problem description, equations and dynamics involved in the solutions and explaining all the programming steps needed to perform the solution in an electronic spreadsheet with its graphical representation and interpretation of the variables, and a description of implications in the changing values of the variables in the mathematical model. At the end of the sequence, in session three, a virtual simulation related to their professional context was used for the reinforcement of all the concepts learned. For analyzing the impact in their learning process, the Normalized Conceptual Gain was used in the pre-test and post-test, results showed a g = 0.85, which represents a high learning and normalized conceptual gain. Finally, the results showed that the computational thinking process can be developed by students, as they must program equations, analyze data, understand it, and identify graphically the variables involved, linking the learning of a physical concept with a computational tool that let them understand in a more clear, specific, and ordered thinking.",2377-634X,978-1-6654-6244-0,10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962398,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962398,Computational thinking;engineering students;electronic spreadsheets for learning;physics courses in engineering;professional skills,Knowledge engineering;Engineering profession;Solids;Mathematical models;Cognition;Software;Engineering students,,1.0,,27.0,IEEE,29 Nov 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

These skills are basic pillars of Computational thinking (CT) and are essential for a computer programmer. Therefore, a programming teacher needs to take these skills into account for the evaluation of students. Existing methods for improving programming competency don’t consider the Computational Thinking of students and perform grading of students without taking these skills into account. Due to this limitation, deficiencies of these skills in students remain unrevealed, posing difficulties for educators to provide need-oriented feedback. The performance of programming students is thus hindered by a lack of interventions. This study proposes a method to evaluate programming students in terms of CT skill components and group them based on their skill set. In this study, 780 students of object-oriented programming (OOP) class were given programming assignments for assessment of programming competencies. These students were then given small programming tasks requiring different computational thinking skill components for their solutions. A machine learning approach was used to perform grouping of these students based on their scores. Six groups of programming students, each having its own set of skill deficiencies, were identified as a result of clustering. One of the groups had an empty set of skill deficiencies and consisted of students proficient in programming. Each of the other five groups had a non-empty set of skill deficiencies and comprised non-proficient programming students. A group-specific skill development plan was built for the groups having skill deficiencies. It was found that such feedback was very effective and improved the CT skill deficiencies of 82% of students.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3391873,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10506466,Computational thinking assessment;feedback;K-means clustering;programming,Programming;Programming profession;Codes;Task analysis;Source coding;Clustering algorithms;Feedback;Cognitive systems;Object oriented programming;Machine learning;Education;Performance evaluation,,,,33.0,CCBYNCND,22 Apr 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

From fall 2020 to fall 2021, 469 students from three institutions in the United States took the diagnostic. The data from 152 students at one institution was used to provide evidence of predictive validity. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses resulted in 20 items loading onto one factor in a good model fit range, with the internal consistency reliability coefficient, Cronbach  $\alpha $  of 0.86. From item analyses based on classical test theory, the diagnostic items on average tended to be slightly easy but had sufficient discrimination power. The correlation matrix for criterion validity evidence indicated that the diagnostic functions well to differentiate students’ computational thinking ability by prior computer science course experience as well as by first-generation status. Predictive validity evidence from regression analyses revealed the statistically significant effect of students’ diagnostic scores assessed at the beginning of the first semester on predicting their end of semester course grades.

It is an everyday task, self-taught and done naturally even by a small child. In spite of its ingenuousness, mastering sorting algorithms turns out to be not so simple for many first-time programmers. This happens because how humans perform sorting is far from being straightforwardly aligned with machine instructions. We have developed an unplugged game-based learning activity that aims not only to tackle this difficult dilemma but also to promote computational thinking practice. Our game robustly challenges audiences to complete a fun sorting task algorithmically and the building blocks of the exercise are methodologically grounded in the four cornerstones of computational thinking. Participants are gently guided through solving a problem by decomposing it, recognizing patterns, applying abstraction, writing step-by-step instructions, and finally arriving at a programmable solution. Our design is largely flexible. The game can be played in small groups or larger ones. It uses only common, readily accessible materials, and is easily adaptable to different levels of audiences, from the interested general public to secondary school students and teachers, to non-computer science undergraduates and those majoring in engineering or information technology related subjects. We have implemented this activity in our classrooms and conducted several workshops. Responses were markedly positive.

The Computational Thinking is an approach of teaching that uses a diverse range of techniques derived from computers for the resolution of these problems combined with the new competencies of the 21st century (critical thinking, collaboration, etc.). The adoption of the notion of Computing within the basic education schools is a concern in many countries, where the implementation occurs in a strict way.

This is one of the first studies to analyze teacher enactment of inquiry-based learning during the implementation of an upper elementary, computational thinking curriculum, and to explore how teacher approaches to inquiry appear to support or constrain multilingual students' development of computational thinking and computer science identities. Design-based research was used to iteratively develop, test, and refine the inquiry-based curriculum, which aligns with computer science and literacy standards, provides linguistic scaffolding, and integrates culturally responsive materials. We adopt a cross-case mixed-methods design to collect data from five teachers and 149 students including detailed field notes, teacher interviews, student computational artifacts, and student identity surveys. Through analyses of teacher moves, we find that teachers adopt different approaches to inquiry that can be indexed along a continuum ranging from open to closed. Patterns in student data revealed that those who received more structured inquiry lessons developed more sophisticated computational artifacts and showed greater identification with the field of computer science.

Therefore, experiences with skills, methodologies, and tools for effective interdisciplinary collaboration and structured problem solving are vital for preparing students for future academic and professional success. Meanwhile, computational systems have permeated much of modern professional and personal life, making computational thinking an essential skill for members of modern society. However, formal training in these techniques is primarily limited to students within computer science, mathematics, management of information systems, and engineering. At Iowa State University, we have designed and offered an experimental course to develop undergraduate students' abilities for interdisciplinary teamwork and to disseminate computational thinking skills to a broader range of students. This novel course was jointly designed and instructed by faculty from the Computer Science Department, Gerontology Program, and Graphic Design Program to incorporate diverse faculty expertise and pedagogical approaches.

Digital games are increasingly a part of our daily lives and are already considered teaching and learning tools. However, its production and documentation is a very complicated task that requires programming skills and knowledge from different areas. This has hampered the development of games in the classroom environment. On the other hand, some teachers have proposed this activity to enable their students to learn school content in a more meaningful way and, consequently, improve learning rates. An alternative for the adoption of game-based learning is an unplugged approach for creating games based on natural language, in which students learn the fundamentals of computing in a playful way and without the use of computers. In this context, this article presents an approach that proposes the creation of games in an unplugged way by using texts produced by students, thus favoring the development of computational thinking and reading and writing skills in the classroom. Also, it may support the students' interest in the computing area by motivating them to enter a higher education course or pursue a career in that area.

Furthermore, in this context there are no guidelines to orientate the creation of didactic activities that will bring about the benefits of CT. Due to the aforementioned information, in this article we present the definition of a collection of guidelines for the construction of didactic activities (CT4AII) that aim to promote Computational Thinking in adolescents with ASD through the construction of digital games. The proposed guidelines were instantiated in a Digital Games Programming Workshop with Scratch. The workshop was offered to four adolescents with ASD, obtaining the development of high-level CT skills and stimulating interpersonal skills that are diminished in this public.

In today’s fast-paced digital age, possessing CT abilities is essential for effective critical thinking and problem-solving across various fields. To cultivate CT proficiency in students from diverse disciplines, we designed an innovative adaptive gamified e-learning platform called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ). The eight key features of CTQ are (1) interactive storyline with customizable avatars, mini-games, and questions; (2) performance profiler; (3) comprehensive question bank with questions at three difficulty levels; (4) feedback and answer to each question; (5) additional learning resources via hyperlinks; (6) badges and leaderboard; (7) progress saving feature; and (8) integrated online feedback survey. The CTQ was introduced to recently enrolled first-year undergraduate students across all five discipline clusters at Singapore Institute of Technology. The learning performance and feedback of 135 students were gathered and examined. The student population comprised 33 Business, Communication and Design (BCD); 48 Health and Social Science (HSS); and 54 Infocomm Technology (ICT) undergraduates. Statistical results from the paired Student’s t-test reveal significant differences (p < 0.05) (i) between the pre-test and post-test scores for HSS, ICT, and all students combined; (ii) between the pre-test duration and post-test duration for all three clusters and all students combined; (iii) between the self-assessed knowledge score before CTQ and after completing CTQ for all three clusters and all students combined. Moreover, majority of the students commented that the CTQ generates interest in CT, is an engaging learning platform with enriching educational content, and has motivated their independent learning.

Then, the synthesis results were integrated into the development of computational thinking through gamification and programming knowledge to improve the efficacy of computational learning. The process commenced with an analysis of the learners' needs obtained through the questionnaires concerning computational thinking. Data analysis illuminated the learners' levels of computational thinking as well as a fundamental understanding of what the learners need to be taught or what areas of skills each learner. With regards to this, conventional teaching approaches may not serve best to transmit the relevant knowledge which may subsequently induce unfavorable attitudes toward computational thinking. With the data elicited through the need assessment, instructors will have a clear direction as to how the pedagogical process should be designed to directly address the needs in each of the computational thinking components. In general, each component of them is rather complex, so the researcher incorporated gamification theory-based learning defined by its enjoyable game mechanisms and challenging nature which makes the coding lesson fun with block programming enabling learners to proficiently grasp the concept of computational thinking.",,978-1-6654-1680-1,10.1109/SEA-STEM53614.2021.9668107,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668107,computational thinking;need assessment;gamification;computational thinking with coding,Systematics;Navigation;Education;Games;Programming;Encoding;Pattern recognition,,1.0,,31.0,IEEE,10 Jan 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In the field of Computer Science, students often struggle with negative emotions during programming activities, impacting their performance and project quality. To address this challenge, there is a growing need to introduce Computational Thinking skills at the pre-university level. This study focuses on understanding the emotions experienced by primary and secondary school students during Computational Thinking activities, involving both plugged and unplugged tools. A significant performance difference was observed between primary and secondary education levels, with the latter outperforming the former. The research identifies specific associations between concepts and emotions, highlighting age-related differences with younger students exhibiting more positive emotions. While gender-based disparities in Computer Science perception exist in secondary education, there are no corresponding distinctions in emotional responses. The study reveals a gender-based effect, with girls showing reduced emotional responses and lower Computational Thinking performance than boys. In summary, this research underscores the profound role of emotions in learning, providing essential insights for tailoring educational strategies considering gender-specific and programming concept-related factors.

In education, the mechanisms used to foster CP are diverse; among them, learning through programming. Databases of source code generated in learning exercises using the CP method are a valuable tool for discovering learning patterns.

However, the software underlying UAS is complex and requires multiple distinct programming skills, e.g., AI, machine learning and flight control. Few programmers encompass these skills, hampering software development and dampening the impact of UAS. We contend that early exposure to UAS software could help align workforce skills. However, early exposure requires curriculum that (1) captures the breadth of UAS software, (2) supports multiple levels of depth for diverse programming backgrounds and (3) fits within resource and institutional challenges. We propose a computational thinking framework. In our approach, lessons fit within 20-30 minute instructional blocks, making them usable in short workshop and extended classroom settings. UAV topics and computational thinking depth link lessons. Teachers can trade breadth for in-depth coding and vice versa. In early work, we presented an autonomous UAS to middle school students.

Therefore, we downloaded 250 projects of different types from the Scratch online platform, and identified the differences and clustered them based on a quantitative measure, the computational thinking score provided by Dr. Scratch. We then triangulated the results by qualitatively studying in detail the source code of the prototypical projects to explain the progression required to move from one cluster to the next one. The result is a data-driven itinerary that can support teachers and policy makers in the creation of a curriculum for learning to program.

Implications about designing CT courses for pre-service teachers are discussed. Background: CT is an essential 21st-century competency that supports the development of problem-solving skills. Inspired by computing science problem-solving practices, CT should transcend disciplines, but few universities or colleges include CT courses or CT content in their core courses. It is also difficult to know what pre-service teachers think about CT and their role in promoting it. Research Questions: Do pre-service teachers' coding reflections reveal any important information about their knowledge of, skills in, and attitudes toward CT? Methodology: Traditional qualitative techniques based on human raters are impractical in analyzing hundreds of essays. Topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning modeling technique, was employed to extract topical features from participants' reflections. In one section of an undergraduate Introduction to Educational Technology course offered at a large university in Western Canada, n = 139 pre-service teachers wrote a short reflection on their experience following a 20 h Accelerated Intro to Computer Science Code.org course. Topics were identified by analyzing contextual trends in participants' written reflections.

The results were statistically significant, suggesting that bringing together CT and mathematics through proper adjustments of classroom practices can have a positive influence on students abilities of solving problems.

The gameplay expects the young children to steer successfully their in-game character with the help of an intuitive symbol language through a set of increasingly complex mazes. The children may even draw sets of symbols by hand thus develop a basic program. Pic2Programs image recognition module will then process these symbols by first photographing them with an Android device and then using a neural network to map the photos to program instructions.

In this paper, CT is represented through the graphical programming language Scratch according to the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick [1]. This project aims to explore the classroom effect of using graphical programming tool in learning English dialogue and investigate how to improve the integration of CT into English education with the elements of programming. To achieve these objectives, a qualitative method was adopted to collect data through class observations, programming projects, and semi-structured interviews. Nine primary students (n = 9) were the targeted participants, who attended extra-curricular lessons for computer programming using Scratch at their school in Hong Kong. The preliminary results show that the introduction of CT into English dialogue learning through graphical programming language can motivate primary school students to study English dialogue. To better connect CT with English education via graphical programming tools, students and the teacher in the group under study suggested making computers interact with people autonomically, designing games in graphical programming environments to encourage English learning, keeping the balance of students' graphical programming language learning skill and their English language skill, and adopting graphical programming language as a tool to finish the summative English language assignments.",2470-6698,978-1-5386-0900-2,10.1109/TALE.2017.8252356,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8252356,Computational Thinking;English dialogue learning;Graphical programming language;Classroom effect,Education;Tools;Programming profession;Computer languages;Interviews;Writing,,8.0,,19.0,IEEE,11 Jan 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

To address this issue, we propose a new dynamic weighted evaluation system (DWES). First, we define a new computational thinking (CT) evaluation criteria from eight aspects. Second, based on the proposed criteria, we present an analysis tool that automatically assesses the CT skills of the learners’ projects. Third, considering the characteristics of projects, we dynamically adjust the evaluation results according to types, so that a single standard is no longer applied roughly to all.

Therefore, this study designed a game-based project to investigate students’ learning motivation and CT performance in different programming environments.

To appreciate the strategies explored to promote teaching and learning of CT in HEIs; evaluate scholarly discussions, contributions, and potential impact of studies in this field, there is a need to ground the theoretical constructs that build the foundation for the field. A literature review methodology was adopted in this study. The data collected from the Web of Science, the Scopus, ACM, and ProQuest databases were analyzed to provide answers to the research questions. The findings from this study suggest that constructionism and constructivism are the prevailing learning theories explored by scholars in this field to deploy CT in HEI. Additionally, the study revealed that activity-based learning, problem-based learning, automatic assessment-based learning, and self-regulated or self-reflective learning are the prominent pedagogies used by educators. These findings provided a strong foundation for research in this growing field. Besides, the findings also create an opportunity for positioning CT in HEI's educational curriculum regarding how CT should be taught in that context.",2377-634X,978-1-6654-3851-3,10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637405,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637405,Computational thinking;pedagogy;learning theory;higher education;university,Technology acceptance model;Systematics;Learning automata;Education;Bibliometrics;Focusing;Drives,,4.0,,56.0,IEEE,20 Dec 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Our principle interest is in CT framings and implementations for K-12 audiences in disciplines other than computer science, thus fulfilling the broad appeal and utility originally prescribed by Wing. We break CT down into its constituent characteristics, and split these characteristics into two principle groups: mechanistic (inextricably tied to and limited by computer science) and humanistic (separable from and adaptable beyond computer science). We use this conceptual bifurcation as a basis for selecting and analyzing implementations of CT for subsequent reporting. We summarize our CT meta-analytical results by distributional themes including grades, disciplinary foci, equity groups, and programming paradigms. In conclusion, we make recommendations for improving K-12 CT curricular implementations.

Several types of trash have piled up in Thailand. Many individuals don’t use the correct way of waste management because they have lacked knowledge and understanding of how to sort rubbish since childhood. To increase the possibility to fully utilize the knowledge of waste separation correctly, the researcher aims to promote computational thinking through the learning of a game called “Trashman”. This game simulates various objects for situations of sorting garbage into the appropriate sorting bin. Trashman has 3 levels in the game. Each level increases the number of bins and the amount of garbage, starting from level 1-3 which refers to easy, moderate, and difficult levels, respectively. The level indicates the error of separating the waste if putting it into a wrong bin type. The educating about different types of waste separation through the game utilizes Mixed Reality (MR) technology of the Magic Leap One device. The developer’s expectation for an alternative learning medium in the form of a game is to allow players to apply their knowledge by practicing computational skills by sorting garbage correctly. The game evaluates and summarizes scores of each level at the game’s end. This will evaluate player’s performance of CT through their ability separating trash.

There are already many Learning Resources (LR) for this training, however, we believe that Neuroeducation can contribute to improving the impact of these LR in the teaching and learning process.

Integrated, transdisciplinary (CS/CT+X) approaches have shown promise for broadening access to CS and CT learning opportunities, addressing potential self-selection bias associated with elective CS coursework and afterschool programs, and promoting a more expansive and authentic contextualization of CS work. Emerging research also points to pedagogical strategies that can transcend simply broadening access, by also working to confront barriers to equitable and inclusive engagement in CS. Yet, approaches to integration vary widely, and there is little consensus on whether and how different models for CS and CT integration contribute to desired outcomes. There has also been little theory development that can ground systematic examination of the affordances and tradeoffs of different models.

Research shows that the task design influences the development of computational thinking (CT). The literature provides evidence that the context, the problem space, and the representation of the problem to apply SRA-programming require the programming task to be embedded in a dynamic context in which a programmable robot must use sensory information to anticipate changes in the environment. In order to ascertain whether the problem space and the task design influence the evocation of SRA-thinking, this article uses a research design comparing the differences between two programming conditions (static/dynamic). In these conditions, pupils use Lego EV-3 robots and Mindstorms software to solve programming problems. As a post-measurement, a Lego challenge is applied. In this article, it is shown that the integration of a dynamic task design to solve a programming problem is essential for a deeper understanding of CT skills. Furthermore, when pupils can immediately test the consequences of their program in a dynamic environment and, thus, the learning environment provides an appropriate problem, they gain a deeper understanding of the added value of sensors and will be better able to reason about complex problems. It is found that programming in a dynamic problem environment almost naturally evokes SRA-thinking, as opposed to programming in a static environment.

Second (if the pathway is deemed valuable) who, in their estimates, are the crucial players to help develop a coherent CS/ CT K-12 pathway and what is their capacity? Third, how can such a prospective pathway be practically implemented? These elements of why, who, and how are essential to wider questions around equity of student access to high quality computing, and with this paper, they come from the perspectives of teachers-a group too often left out of early discussions around K-12 curricular design.

We believe that CT skills should be developed and encouraged from a young age. However, to promote the development of CT it is necessary to use appropriate materials, which we call Learning Resources (LR). For a more efficient development of CT, it is important that the LR are designed and used in order to obtain the maximum potential of the resource. Scientific evidence from Neuroeducation can be used to fully explore LR. There are many LR available to promote CT, however, they are not correctly classified in order to be easy to understand what specific CT skills they stimulate, neither which ages they are adequate for. Directions for their most convenient usage are also lacking. This paper aims to present an approach to categorize these LR so that when a teacher intends to promote the development of one or more specific CT skills, in a given schooling year, he can find the adequate LR more easily, and also get educational resources concerning their use. This characterization approach is based on OntoCnE ontology. OntoCnE was built by us and is composed of 4 layers that define: how to develop CT (1); which concepts should be taught at each school level (2); which materials are appropriate for each skill (3); and the Neuroeducation guidelines associated with each resource (4). This paper essentially focuses on layers 3 and 4 to perform the LR characterization. To illustrate our approach, we will follow OntoCnE statements to categorize a set of LRs. With this methodological setting we intend to build a catalog of LR more effectively promote CT skills on children.",2476-2172,979-8-3503-7661-6,10.1109/SIIE63180.2024.10604485,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10604485,Computational Thinking;Ontology;OntoCnE;Learning Resources;Neuroeducation,Systematics;Education;Ontologies;Problem-solving;Programming profession;Guidelines,,,,16.0,IEEE,29 Jul 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Our survey encompassed two aspects: (1) teachers' perceptions of CT, and (2) their intentions to integrate CT into pedagogical activities. 38 teachers, mostly in Engineering Education, from across the Netherlands completed the questionnaire based on the UTAUT framework. Regarding CT perceptions, our investigation reveals that teachers possess an inadequate understanding of the relationship between CT and Computer Science, have limited training experiences in CT, and hold differing opinions on when and which constructs of CT should be integrated into different domains. Concerning teachers' intentions to integrate CT, the results exhibited a strong positive correlation between performance expectancy, attitude towards CT, and behavioral intention to implement CT in learning activities.

Background: Different teaching approaches for programming are widely available; however, being able to formulate an algorithmic solution computationally and then transform it into code is essential for students. Research Questions: What are the effective teaching approaches for fostering the development of problem-solving and programming skills? How do CT concepts contribute to the formulation of a PSA model for programming problems and its translation into an effective teaching method? How can an effective teaching method that utilizes the PSA model be identified and distinguished from other approaches? Methodology: A preliminary study pointed out the difficulties experienced when teaching programming, inspiring the formulation of a PSA model that used CT concepts. An experimental study on problem-based and game-based programming workshops that utilized the PSA model through sorting algorithms was performed on experimental groups consisting of 30 students each. A syntax-based programming workshop consisting of 30 students was used as the control group. All the participants were recruited through a pretest that incorporated basic programming questions.

Especially for novices, collaboration among learners with diverse experiences, values, and knowledge can be especially effective. However, there is limited research on how collaborative interactions among learners from different undergraduate disciplines manifest during the learning of computational concepts. This qualitative study investigates interaction among learners in small interdisciplinary student groups in an undergraduate computational thinking (CT) class. In analyzing the social interactions of cohort members, the Differentiating Overt Learning Activities (DOLA) framework developed by Chi was used as a starting point. Several themes (e.g. explain-to-other, self-monitor, connect/plan) suggested by Chi’s overt activities framework emerged naturally in the observations. However, several categories that were not explicitly stated in the DOLA framework also emerged. These are: asking a shallow question versus asking an elaborate question, socializing, being confused or expressing frustration, self-talk, and struggle. Analysis of interactions between cohort members revealed that most of the group interactions were active in nature. Barriers to collaborative learning were accentuated when peers were novices. Students who lacked knowledge of computational concepts found it hard to contribute to a discussion, hindering learning, whereas students who had better conceptual understanding were constructive in their interactions, elaborated on a topic, made connections with previous problems, and displayed self-awareness about their understanding.",2377-634X,978-1-6654-6244-0,10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962505,National Science Foundation; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962505,Computational Thinking;Collaboration;Undergraduate Instruction;Qualitative Research;Data Science,Codes;Federated learning;Semantics;Collaboration;Writing;Syntactics;Problem-solving,,,,21.0,IEEE,29 Nov 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Game-Based Assessment for Computational Thinking: A Systematic Review,Q. Luo; S.

The game-based assessment appears to address this issue by analyzing students' behaviors and reactions during the gameplay process., which has become an emerging assessment tool in CT education. This drives the need for a comprehensive overview of this field. To fill this gap., this study aims to conduct a systematic literature review on the assessment of CT through games. It explores CT skills assessed through games., focusing on target groups, game forms., and benefits. A total of fifteen studies were examined. Findings indicate that algorithmic thinking, problem decomposition, pattern recognition., and abstraction were commonly assessed in games.

The collaboration was designed to develop CS/CT knowledge, understanding, skills and application among participants. In phase one of the project, pre-service and in-service teachers explored CS educational hard/software platforms and used open-source sites such as Sphero Edu, Wonder Workshop, Scratch and Code.org. They envisioned how activities apply to K-8 classrooms, and they worked collaboratively to design a problem-based project for their own students. In phase two of the project, teacher preparation faculty were trained to integrate CS and CT into several preservice courses as well as build into the coursework sequence meaningful experiences that would expose future teachers to CS and CT knowledge and skills so that they could then incorporate these into their own K-8 lesson plans. Project evaluation included formative and summative assessments to examine changes in content and pedagogical knowledge.

At the elementary level, computational thinking (CT) has been used as a framework for bringing CS ideas into the classroom and educating teachers about how they can integrate CT into their daily instruction. A number of these projects have made equity a central goal of their work by working in schools with diverse racial, linguistic, and economic diversity. However, we know little about whether and how teachers equitably engage students in CT during their classroom instruction-particularly during science and math lessons. In this paper, we present an approach to analyzing classroom instructional videos using the EQUIP tool (https://www.equip.ninja/). The purpose of this tool is to examine the quantity and quality of students' contributions during CT-integrated math and science lessons and how it differs based on demographic markers.

The effects of emphasizing computational thinking in an introductory programming course,S.

To counter this, we devised a form of structured pseudocode, designed to highlight and facilitate algorithmic construction so that the complexities of the programming language can be deferred until proficiency in design has been reached. Students taught with this experimental approach are not introduced to the language itself, or the compiler, until the last few weeks of the semester. A controlled experiment comparing this approach with a traditional language-based pedagogy has revealed that by the end of the course, studentspsila programming skills, even on language-specific tasks, is every bit as strong as students taught traditionally, and that their comfort level with modularity (writing functions) is increased.

One of the methods to improve learning engagement is through a research framework called Unified Theory Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). This paper adopted 17 UTAUT questions to compare with research variables (pre-post surveys and genders). The user acceptance and use of technology or UTAUT consisted of Likert scale (Strongly disagree to Strongly Agree) questions, computed to generate total scores for each participant. Then, the scores will be compared to each variable to investigate the relationships between these variables against the UTAUT. This study could be implemented via online learning, but in the end, the offline (unplugged) method was the only method to deliver the learning activities. There is limited evidence discussing UTAUT within the area of offline learning; hence, this paper will focus on another spectrum regarding the UTAUT study. Instead of mobile (online) learning engagement, this paper studies the relationship between unplugged learning with user acceptance and the use of technology. Spearman correlation indicated that the unplugged learning approach has a significant positive relationship with user acceptance and use of technology. It revealed that students may also demonstrate an interest in online learning engagement and be able to comprehensively accept the online learning approach. In contrast, Mann-Whitney U test analysis on genders revealed no significant difference. The findings could contribute to another noteworthy discussion regarding the validity of user acceptance and the use of technology against the unplugged learning approach.",,979-8-3503-0268-4,10.1109/ICOCO59262.2023.10397736,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10397736,UTAUT;computational thinking;unplugged learning,Surveys;Correlation;Computational modeling;Hybrid learning,,,,31.0,IEEE,24 Jan 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Over the past year, results from an initial validation attempt were used to refine diagnostic questions. A second statistical validation attempt was then completed in Spring 2021 with 191 student participants at three universities. Statistics show that all diagnostic questions had statistically significant factor loadings onto one general computational thinking factor that incorporates the five original factors of (a) Abstraction, (b) Algorithmic Thinking, (c) Decomposition, (d) Data Representation and Organization, and (e) Impact of Computing. This result was unexpected as our goal was a diagnostic that could discriminate among the five factors. A small population size caused by the virtual delivery of courses during the COVID-19 pandemic may be the explanation and a third round of validation in Fall 2021 is expected to result in a larger population given the return to face-to-face instruction. When statistical validation is completed, the diagnostic will help institutions identify students with strong entry level skills in computational thinking as well as students that require academic support. The diagnostic will inform curriculum design by demonstrating which factors are more accessible to engineering students and which factors need more time and focus in the classroom. The long-term impact of a successfully validated computational thinking diagnostic will be introductory engineering courses that better serve engineering students coming from many backgrounds. This can increase student self-efficacy, improve student retention, and improve student enculturation into the engineering profession.

While computational thinking theory is still developing, empirical studies can help further understand how students demonstrate this knowledge and their progression in attaining the practices. Therefore, with this empirical study, the following questions are addressed. RQ1: What are the differences in students' computational thinking practices at the beginning of an undergraduate introductory programming course? RQ 2: How do these differences correspond to the acquisition of more advanced computational thinking practices? The use of a descriptive non-experimental design that aims to understand the correlation between practices related to data and computational problem-solving is presented. A machine learning technique is employed, utilizing historical data from introductory programming for a problem-solving course with more than 1000 first-year engineering students. After identifying groups of students defining different profiles, data from posterior performance in more advanced programming topics were descriptively analyzed. This study supports the characterization of four different student profiles demonstrating differences in their performance at the beginning of the semester. From these four profiles, two of them show a subsequent differential progression besides their similarity at the beginning of the semester. In this particular case, troubleshooting and debugging appear as a relevant competency when distinguishing these two learners' groups. These findings suggest that previous knowledge or exposure to different practices can result in different progressions of more complex computational practices, emphasizing the relevance of troubleshooting and debugging as a practice required for a successful and timely progression on the acquisition of other computational thinking practices.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3061277,"U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:EEC #1826099,EEC #1449238); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9360590,Engineering education;engineering students;pattern analysis;statistical learning,Computational modeling;Problem-solving;Data models;Taxonomy;Programming profession;Tools;Mathematical model,,11.0,,31.0,CCBY,22 Feb 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Prioritization of these standards does not always align with the experience of students at Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSI). The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) 2013 Computer Science Curricula guidelines highlight version control as one of many core tools in the Social Issues and Professional Practice (SP) Knowledge Area students should experience in their upper-level software engineering courses. Research has demonstrated that at this level, students receive exposure to the tool but are not able to gain sufficient mastery. Other researchers have advocated for version control being introduced earlier in the computer science curricula. There is limited research that indicates that this particular tool improves the learning outcomes for students or significantly complements the other ACM Knowledge Areas.

Students were asked to programmatically choreograph dance performances for virtual characters within an educational desktop application we built earlier called Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). As part of a middle school science class, 90 students from the 6th and 7th grades participated in our study. All students first visually programmed dance choreography for a virtual character they created in VEnvI on a laptop. Then, they viewed and interacted with the resulting dance performance in a between-subjects design in one of the three conditions. We compared and contrasted the benefits of embodied immersive virtual reality (EVR) viewing utilizing a head-mounted display with a body-scaled and gender-matched self-avatar, immersive virtual reality only (IVR) viewing, and desktop VR (NVR) viewing with VEnvI on pedagogical outcomes, programming performance, presence, and attitudes towards STEM and computational thinking. Results from a cognition questionnaire showed that, in the learning dimensions of Knowledge and Understanding (Bloom's taxonomy) as well as Multistructural (SOLO taxonomy), participants in EVR and IVR scored significantly higher than NVR. Also, participants in EVR scored significantly higher than IVR. We also discovered similar results in objective programming performance and presence scores in VEnvI. Furthermore, students’ attitudes towards computer science, programming confidence, and impressions significantly improved to be the highest in EVR and then IVR as compared to NVR condition.

We provide visualization and evaluation techniques to find hidden patterns in the students’ solutions which allow teachers to predict the specific behavior of students or to prevent some student mistakes or misconceptions in advance or further pedagogical intervention. Background: Formal concept analysis is a method of unsupervised Machine Learning that applies mathematical lattice theory to organize data based on objects and their shared attributes. Several fuzzy extensions of formal concept analysis have a great potential to visualize and evaluate students’ solutions, to categorize the solutions into overlapping biclusters (formal concepts) or to generate the attribute implications between extracted attributes. Research Question: Does formal concept analysis describe the various solutions and the relationships between the extracted attributes of students’ solutions in the educational and computational thinking game Light-Bot? Methodology: Targeting the evaluation of 64 students’ solutions in the Light-Bot game, we construct the formal contexts of the extracted attributes. We apply formal concept analysis to construct the concept lattices from two binary formal contexts and to generate attribute implications and their fuzzy counterparts to find the dependencies between the extracted attributes. Findings: The results of our paper provide a description of various students’ solutions which are visualized in the concept lattices. 1) Regarding the concept lattice of binary formal contexts, we obtained the characterization of the largest biclusters which includes a description of the largest group of similar solutions. 2) The attribute implications mainly reveal the characterization of similar solutions, e.g., with a higher count of executed commands in solutions. 3) Using fuzzy attribute implications, we obtained the characterization of solutions with unnecessary commands, going out of the game area, or using indirect recursion.",1557-9638,,10.1109/TE.2024.3442612,"Project KEGA titled by The Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Teaching of School Informatics in Secondary Schools(grant numbers:010UPJ,4/2024); Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic titled by Proposal of Novel Methods in the Field of Formal Concept Analysis and their Application(grant numbers:VEGA 1/0645/22); Slovak Research and Development Agency(grant numbers:APVV-20-0069); Scientific Grant Agency (VEGA)(grant numbers:VEGA 2/0097/20); European Regional Development Fund(grant numbers:313011BWH2); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10669100,Attribute implications;formal concept analysis;light-bot;visualization,Games;Formal concept analysis;Education;Lighting;Programming profession;Lattices;Robots,,,,,IEEE,6 Sep 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles

Educational robotics was particularly negatively affected by this period. In our country, educational robotics is usually taught in informatics classes. However, in many schools, the teaching of informatics during the lockdown was very limited and often focused only on basic digital skills. As a similar situation occurred in several European countries, the idea of supporting teachers in such cases was proposed. Within an international project we are involved in, a methodology is being designed to develop computational thinking in students at all school levels through educational robotics in combination with a school arts subject. The methodology is based on the idea of project-based learning and should use blended learning methods. In this paper, we describe the planning and the course of an educational activity – a project – using the currently developed methodology. The results presented are from its pilot validation with lower-secondary students without previous experience with robotics. The project combined the theme of Greek myths with robotics using LEGO SPIKE Prime. During the validation, we focused primarily on students’ work with basic programming concepts. Our research problem was to validate the quality and potential of the proposed methodology and the computational thinking skills it can develop.

Computer science has traditionally been primarily a university level discipline and there are no widely accepted general standards for what computer science at K-12 level entails. Also, as the interest in this area is rather new, the amount of research conducted in the field is still limited.

The countries are Australia, England, Estonia, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, South Korea, Poland and USA. The studied countries either emphasize digital competencies together with programming or the broader subject of computer science or computing.

Teaching Structured Authoring and DITA Through Rhetorical and Computational Thinking,C. Evia; M. R. Sharp; M. A.

This teaching case describes how component content management and DITA were integrated into the Creating User Documentation course of an undergraduate professional writing program. Research questions: How can instructors of technical and professional writing best teach English and humanities students to operate within a structured authoring workflow? How can computational abstraction be combined with students' previously acquired genre knowledge to ease their adoption of the DITA to create technical documentation? Situating the case: The development of this course was informed by literature from a variety of scholarly and industry sources, which reveal connections between DITA, computational thinking, and Rhetorical Genre theory. Specifically, the concept of “layers of abstraction” guides the development of the course's structure, allowing students to separate and independently process the various aspects of a structured authoring workflow. How the case was studied: The case was studied informally through the experience of the authors as they developed and taught the course, through informal discussions and structured interviews with industry professionals, and through student reflections from discussion forum posts from Fall 2012 through Fall 2013. About the case: Initially developed with a focus on print manuals and online help, the course began teaching topic-based authoring in the mid-2000s; however, most enterprise-level editors and tools were cost-prohibitive for students and faculty. Furthermore, many computing concepts associated with structured authoring were intimidating for an audience of students in an English department. An affordable solution was adopting the open-source DITA standard, using free trials or open-source editors. The intimidation factor was minimized by designing the course around five layers of abstraction that draw on students' previous rhetorical knowledge: Layer 1: Developing quality documentation, Layer 2: Separating content from design, Layer 3: Authoring granular content with XML, Layer 4: Authoring and linking Component Content Management modules with DITA, and Layer 5: Single-sourcing and content reuse. This case discusses each layer of abstraction, the associated assignments for each layer, and the results of each layer based on student feedback. Results and conclusions: Although the course is not universally loved by students, it has seen many successes and provides a much-needed foundation in component content management and structured authoring for students who might become technical communicators. The teaching team has learned to avoid overemphasizing coding and automation in structured authoring, maintain a solid grounding on writing principles and good technical communication requirements, and draw upon students' existing knowledge of genres and their constraints.",1558-1500,,10.1109/TPC.2016.2516639,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7393614,Abstractions;computer languages;DITA;documentation;rhetoric;standards;writing;XML,Documentation;Content management;Computer languages;XML;Rhetoric;Writing,,21.0,,40.0,IEEE,26 Jan 2016,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

In this exploratory and preliminary study, we investigate how appropriate the Bebras challenge is as an instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. Bebras is an international challenge whose goal is to promote Computer Science and CT. The test can be answered without any prior knowledge on computer science. Our broad research question is whether we can evolve Bebras into a full fledged instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. In this paper, we instantiate a few more specific research questions: Is Bebras performance a good predictor of success for students within programming courses? Is there any correlation between Bebras performance and students' grades? Do students improve their performance in Bebras tests when exposed to the contents of a programming course? Our dataset consists of the grades of 138 students who attended introductory programming courses at two Brazilian universities and their performance in two simulated Bebras tests. The first test was applied at the beginning of the term and therefore before any exposition to programming classes. The second one was applied at the end of the term. The results suggest that the performance on Bebras is only moderately correlated to the student grades. We conclude that it is not very likely that CT measures can be derived from the Bebras test as it is currently designed. While further research is needed on how we can leverage the Bebras effort to extend it into a CT assessment instrument, we performed a preliminary study on the use of Item Response Theory (IRT) as a means to improve the selection of questions and the design of the test.

Objective: This work proposes to characterize the literature on CT&P in K-12 education in Brazil. Results: through a systematic mapping study, we collected information on year, venue, type, K-12 education stage and modality, methodological contexts, and used tools and programming languages from 338 selected primary studies from 2001 until 2016. Conclusions: there is a significant increase in the number of Brazilian studies in the latest years, showing a growing interest on this research area as well as several trends and gaps to be addressed by both researchers and practitioners.",2377-634X,978-1-5386-1174-6,10.1109/FIE.2018.8658828,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658828,,Education;Programming profession;Tools;Systematics;Data mining;Computer languages,,13.0,,33.0,IEEE,7 Mar 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Given the well-known skills demanded for the 21st century, CT needs to be known in the teacher community. One crucial aspect in this regard is the perceptions that students hold on the subject as well as on Computing in general. Various studies have been carried out to measure students' attitudes towards Computing. However, assessing the understanding of CT and Computing attitudes in undergraduate education, and particularly in teacher education, has not been fully explored yet. Most current instruments are either not aimed at educators or not designed to cover elements related to both CT and Computing. In this work, our goal was to evaluate a survey instrument on perceptions of CT and attitudes towards Computing for undergraduate students. Our evaluation focused on verifying whether the instrument could grasp the aspects involved in five different intended constructs: 1) understanding of CT, 2) application of CT in classroom, 3) confidence to learn Computing, 4) interest for Computing and 5) perception of Computing usefulness. After applying the instrument with 2,290 undergraduate students, we computed its reliability and used confirmatory factor analysis results to measure its validity. Results showed evidence that the instrument is both reliable and valid to measure impressions of CT and Computing attitudes in an educational context.",2165-9567,978-1-7281-8478-4,10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453940,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453940,,Instruments;Current measurement;Conferences;Reliability;Engineering education,,2.0,,18.0,IEEE,18 Jun 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Numerous studies in the last decade shed light on disseminating CT practices. However, there is still a gap in understanding CT as a construct, that is, CT as a complex cognitive dimension. Furthermore, few studies analyze how many constructs can be recognized inside CT by empirical data. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is one of the essential skills in CT, even when we do not apply programming activities. In this exploratory paper, we investigate the Bebras Challenge tasks. Our primary aim is to figure out how many and which are the constructs associated with CT skills derived from data, especially related to algorithmic thinking. The results point out three primary constructs supported by data. We claim that these constructs are a mix of CT skills, mainly algorithmic thinking, abstraction, generalization, evaluation, and pattern recognition. In addition, our study provides additional evidence supporting the idea that algorithmic thinking can be explored by different perspectives beyond “a set of order instructions”, even without programming practices. Thus, this result reinforces the notion that CT can be understood as a mix of several skills to solve problems. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is a complex cognitive process of thought which may be explored through different strategies. We believe that these findings may help recognize which constructs and abilities underline CT, primarily algorithmic thinking without programming activities.",2377-634X,978-1-6654-3851-3,10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637151,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637151,,Cognitive processes;Conferences;Pattern recognition;Task analysis;Programming profession,,2.0,,27.0,IEEE,20 Dec 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The model blends six critical types of thinking, i.e., logical thinking, systems thinking, sustainable thinking, strategic thinking, creative thinking, and responsible thinking into the design of a first-year undergraduate programming course. The study describes a creative blended pedagogy that embeds the proposed model into the course plan. Background: The emergence of artificial intelligent systems such as large language models from a knowledge provider perspective, coupled with a gradual change in post-pandemic outlook of education challenge the relevance and raises concerns about the future of education. The 21st-century human CT requirements, viz., learning to code (skill) and thinking computationally (competency), will be inadequate in the future. Moreover, there is substantial evidence which shows that most introductory programming courses fail to integrate critical elements like ethics and responsibility as part of the course. Intended Outcomes: The authors anticipate experiential learning models such as this has immense potential to future-proof CS education, as well as make future software engineers responsible citizens. Application Design: The proposed model blends six types of thinking into the design and activities of the course. The underlying theoretical basis of these activities revolve around three key principles: 1) experiential learning; 2) self-reflection; and 3) peer learning.

To improve student engagement in quantitative based course like Math, Accounting or Science; it is of supreme importance that students are able to make connections between knowledge and its application to a real world context. Two such cases of Contextual Learning have been presented in this paper which was modeled in implementation of interdisciplinary projects across Accounting and IT disciplines, with Business students enrolled in Managerial Accounting and Cost Accounting courses and CIS students in Mobile Application course and ICT. This study aims at presenting a contextual strategy used to enhance Accounting and IT skills in Undergraduate students at Dubai Women's College, Higher Colleges of Technology. We posited that through this contextualized approach, students would see Accounting, Computational thinking and app development as tools for solving work-related problems. Using Constructivist teaching and REACT (relating, experience, application, collaboration and transfer) strategy; we initiated curriculum integration of both Accounting and IT, which deviates from traditional teaching model where learning of a subjects is isolated from any context.

At this district, equity challenges have arisen as the city has grown rapidly over the past decade, shifting from a rural and predominantly White college town to a burgeoning tech sector with a significant influx of Latinx families. During the first two years of participation in the Developing Inclusive K-12 Computing Pathways Research Practice Partnership (CT Pathways), the district developed a computing pathways document to guide schools and teachers in the integration of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT). After a year piloting their pathway, an Inclusive CT Pathways Committee was formed to review the existing pathways document and ensure it was ably addressing the district's overall equity goal of better serving students from Black and Latinx communities. As an orientation step to personalize this goal and understand it within the context of their own classrooms and schools, teachers on the Inclusive CT Committee conducted empathy interviews to learn more about the computing experiences of their students. Teachers reflected upon the structure of the interview protocol, the insights they gained, and the potential opportunities the approach afforded them to address misconceptions about computing.

A key element in delivering high-quality PD is understanding the specific educational and wider cultural needs of the community where it will be delivered, something we call “mining cultural capital”. In this poster, we report on the delivery of four 30-minute virtual PD sessions within two rural school districts in Eastern Kentucky: Pikeville Independent and Floyd County Schools. The virtual sessions were specifically geared toward elementary and middle school teachers. The sessions were led by a long-time educator in the region who worked to curate relevant examples and delivered the PD via a recorded video conference. The recordings are available for teachers in the region to watch and re-watch as they develop their lessons. Survey results showed that participating teachers found the PD to be valuable.

Offering efficient educational games that promote computational thinking competencies requires personalized learning paths through adaptive difficulty. The research presented herein is a first attempt to define a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges using log data obtained from Kodetu, which is a block-based maze game. Specifically, we conducted three studies with 9- to 16-year-old students who were asked to solve sequences of maze-based programming challenges. Using log data from these studies, we investigated the maze characteristics and the coding limitations that affect performance in the challenges and calculated the performance obtained by the participants using a fuzzy rule-based system. The results showed that the turns in a maze, the number of total steps of a maze, and the blocks provided affect student performance.

To this end we contrasted empirical evidence of their performance in the two tasks with their verbal account of experience with AgentSheets. We used a combination of discourse analysis and inspections using Semiotic Engineering methods and the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework. Our findings go in two directions. First, we observed that additional representations have allowed participants to expand and correct previous learning.

Unplugged Robotics to Increase K-12 Students’ Engineering Interest and Attitudes,B. Miller; A. Kirn; M. Anderson; J. C. Major; D. Feil-Seifer; M.

However, the integration of computing remains obstructed by resources and lack of professional development to support students' learning. Further challenging is students' STEM attitudes and interest do not matriculate with them into higher education. This issue is especially critical for traditionally under represented and underserved populations including females, racial/ethnic minority groups, and students of low-socioeconomic status (SES). To help mitigate challenges, we developed an unplugged (computer-less) computing engineering and robotics lesson composed of two introductory computing concepts, sequencing and decision-making, using a small robot arm and tangible programming blocks. Through students' sequencing of operations, debugging, and executing complex robotic behavior, we seek to determine if students' interest or attitudes change toward engineering. Nine one-hour introductory pilot lessons with 148 students, grades 6-10, at two public middle schools, and one summer camp were conducted. We measured students' engineering interest and attitudes through a 15 question pre- and post-lesson survey and calculated aggregate factor scores for interest and attitudes. We found low-SES students' a priori interests and attitudes tend to be lower and more varied than those of their high-SES peers. These preliminary results suggest that the integration of introductory computing and robotics lessons in low-SES classrooms may help students reach similar levels of engineering interest and attitudes as their high-SES peers.",2377-634X,978-1-5386-1174-6,10.1109/FIE.2018.8658959,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658959,robotics;computational thinking;K-12,Robot sensing systems;Debugging;Programming profession;Education,,13.0,,27.0,IEEE,7 Mar 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Deployment of physics simulation apps using Easy JavaScript Simulations,,,2017 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON),8 Jun 2017,2017,,,1093,1096,"Physics simulations are widely used to improve the learning process in science and engineering education. Deployment of a computational physics simulation/model is extremely complex given the fact that both knowledge and skills for the science equations and the computational and programming aspects are required for a fully functional simulation, typically requiring a science educator and computer scientists/developer to work together. However, when using Easy JavaScript Simulation (EjsS) modeling toolkit, the instructor can be both the science educator and computer programmer, only needing to define the simulation variables, model and view, and the modeling toolkit can generate the computer codes for the physics simulation. Moreover, the programming aspects can become even more complex if simulations require being optimized for both Android and iOS mobile devices. The current version of EjsS provides instructors with an authoring tool that includes facilities for the creation of such JavaScript simulations as mobile apps, thus simplifying the purely programming aspects.

Sabitzer,"Dept. of STEM Education, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria; C. for Business Language & Intercultural Communication, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria; Dept. of STEM Education, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria",2020 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),4 Dec 2020,2020,,,1,5,"Innovative Practice Work in Progress Paper. Grammar is often taught explicitly in the course of foreign language instruction despite potential misgivings about the details of effectiveness. Different approaches rest on different conceptual and pedagogical rationales, which in turn rely on different forms of conceptual and empirical research. We seek to extend a COOL Informatics approach to grammar instruction in foreign language teaching. COOL Informatics is the acronym for Cooperative and Computer Science supported Open Learning and adopts a neurodidactic approach to teaching in general, in which processes of deduction and generalisation are supported by computational methods of storing, representing and explaining points of language usage. In addition, this represents an opportunity for cross-curricular cooperation between teaching in computer science and language. From neurodidactics we know that the learning and memorizing process in the brain can be supported by using advance organizers such as concept maps for visualizing and structuring the learning contents. With the visual language UML, the Unified Modeling Language, and other diagram types, the field of computer science offers a wide range of such advance organizers. They can be applied for quite a lot of purposes or learning and teaching situations. In this paper we focus on the benefits of computer science models for grammar instruction in foreign language classes aiming at making grammar visible, comprehensible and memorable. We present several ideas for the use of UML diagrams for describing, explaining and learning grammar rules and structures in lucid diagrams. Especially activity and class diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams seem to be very helpful as our experiences gained so far suggest. The paper describes the COOL Informatics teaching approach and it draws a connection between computer science and foreign languages. Furthermore, it shows how to use different types of UML diagrams for visualizing different aspects of grammar teaching and learning. We summarize the most important experiences and results from our last projects related to modeling and present the newest study on UML for grammar learning with some preliminary results.",2377-634X,978-1-7281-8961-1,10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274063,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274063,modeling;UML;grammar instruction;computational thinking,Grammar;Unified modeling language;Education;Computational modeling;Informatics;Computer science;Tools,,2.0,,28.0,IEEE,4 Dec 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

For this first stage, we conducted a pilot study aimed at conducting a differentiated measurement of cognitive loads through secondary tasks and a subjective scale. The pilot study consisted of three moments. The first one focused on measuring their working memory capacity and their prior knowledge of statistics. Then, students worked on a learning activity focused on using Chi-square and Pearson correlation to conduct inferential analyses. The study included two different instructional designs in the form of computational notebooks. Design 1 consisted of correct and incomplete examples, while Design 2 included correct, incomplete, and incorrect examples. Simultaneously, students had to attend to a secondary task, which consisted of responding to an auditory stimulus, after which they had to press a key on their keyboard. Finally, students completed a naïve rating scale of cognitive loads involved in the task. The results highlight the important role of prior knowledge in different instructional designs and how it connects to students' perceived cognitive effort. Likewise, the differences in the instructional designs influenced students' cognitive loads, suggesting a differentiated measure of extraneous loads. Using incorrect examples in learning statistics and programming may affect students' perceived difficulty without resulting in a better learning outcome.",2377-634X,978-1-6654-6244-0,10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962606,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962606,Cognitive load;Computational Statistics;Computational Thinking;Subjective Scale;Secondary Task;Working Memory,Presses;Correlation;Keyboards;Cognitive load;Task analysis;Programming profession,,1.0,,14.0,IEEE,29 Nov 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Work in progress — analyzing the gap between diagrams and code in computer science,S. Davies,University of Mary Washington,2008 38th Annual Frontiers in Education Conference,22 Dec 2008,2008,,,T2C-16,T2C-17,"Students in sophomore computer science (ldquoCS 2rdquo) are required to study the properties of a number of standard data structures; that is, common patterns of organizing data in a computer program. Typically, students are first presented with diagrams that graphically depict the data structure, and then shown sample code that actually implements it. We have observed, however, that there is a sizable gap between these two representations, and that many students who master the former have great difficulty translating that knowledge into the latter. We suspect that our pedagogy could be made more effective by treating diagrams themselves as formal entities, and providing students with a way of mapping operations on the ldquoeasyrdquo (pictorial) domain into the ldquohardrdquo (programmatic) domain. To help develop this technique, we carried out a semester-long experiment in which students demonstrated their understanding of the material both in diagrams and in code.

Applications of Machine Learning to Form-giving in Industrial Design,H. -H.

In particular, image classification using deep learning has been successfully applied to many fields. Although industrial designers might learn this is an opportunity for their best practice, studies demonstrating how to integrate the technology into the design process are rare. Thus, we discussed the need to introduce ML to industrial design by presenting examples and ML tools with lower scientific thresholds such as Weka that is preferable for industrial design students and practitioners.

Machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and AI in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing curricula.

Game-based environments are often used to develop these skills, but they lack sufficient voluntariness to assess aspects related to intrinsic motivation, such as interests, skills, persistence in solving a problem and behavior in response to rewards. These aspects directly affect achievement and academic performance, so it is necessary to analyze possible age and gender differences in order to adjust Computational Thinking curricula. With this aim, we deployed a voluntary video game which addresses basic computational concepts, based on intrinsic motivation, and aimed at early ages. Data were collected and analyzed using game learning analytics for 15 months, during which 4124 users played more than 28187 games. The analysis shows significant age and gender differences in relation to interests, skills, achievement, and progression through attempts. It was observed that the concepts addressed were achievable between the ages of 3 and 6 years and full mastery was possible by the age of 4 years, regardless of gender, as children persist with the challenge, intrinsically motivated, until it is overcome. In terms of persistence, significantly different behaviors were observed in the face of the challenge, which can help us to adjust the different learning methodologies to each age group and gender, adapting the way we provide reinforcement and rewards, especially for boys in the more complex challenges and for girls from the age of 5 years onwards.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3110475,"Madrid Regional Government through the Project e-Madrid-CM(grant numbers:S2018/TCS-4307); European Structural and Investment Funds, namely the European Social Fund (FSE) and the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9529183,Computational thinking;early ages;game learning analytics;interests;intrinsic motivation;learn to program;persistence;rewards;skills;video games,Games;Education;Programming profession;Data mining;Problem-solving;Tools,,14.0,,65.0,CCBY,3 Sep 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

One step towards achieving it is learning to analyse and create algorithms. Researchers have long been trying to establish how the form of representation of algorithms (pseudocode versus flowchart) affects its understanding and have reached varying, sometimes conflicting results. This article presents findings that provide objective new data on this topic. In our experiment, we used two different types of algorithmic tasks with three levels of complexity and a group of 114 research participants with varying programming skills. In addition, we used an eye tracking technique that allowed us to collect detailed information about the subjects’ attention distribution during analysis of algorithms. Our results show that subjects took significantly less time to analyse flowcharts (than they did with pseudocode), made much fewer errors, and had higher confidence in the correctness of their solution. Based on eye tracking data, a reduced number of both re-analyses of the algorithm and input data re-referencing was observed for graphically presented tasks. The difference in favour of flowcharts was revealed (with few exceptions) for all levels of algorithm complexity (simple, medium, complex), while regarding the duration of analysis the advantage of flowcharts increased with the growing complexity of algorithms. For complex algorithms, a significant relationship was observed between algorithm presentation and level of programming skills versus the duration of task solving and confidence level. Our study strongly supports the idea of using graphic representation of algorithms both when learning to code and in acquiring computational thinking skills.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3230981,Scientific Research Fund of the Pedagogical University of Krakow; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9994685,Coding;computational thinking;eye tracking;flowchart;pseudocode;solving algorithmic problems,Flowcharts;Codes;Gaze tracking;Task analysis;Computer languages;Education;Programming profession,,3.0,,40.0,CCBY,20 Dec 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

The growing importance of “flipping the classroom” and the needful emphasizing of online-learning were owed to the situation. To meet these requirements, materials and tasks must be adapted. The Open Educational Resource (OER) textbook “Computational Thinking with the BBC micro:bit” was developed for the introduction of Computational Thinking (CT) for 10-14-year-old pupils in Austria's secondary schools. Example tasks in the textbook are designed with an open end and present extensions with ideas for further development instead of ending abruptly. This article provides a guideline for a clear distinction in redesigning existing lessons following the Inverted Classroom Model (ICM) using videos for pre-class work and live task extensions for in-class work. Which parts in the learning design must remain as live lessons and which parts can be adapted for video lessons? The respective research shows that examples that have a makerspace activity as an extension are especially helpful for an efficient determination of the appropriate part in the learning design and particularly suitable for an adaptation with ICM. The central advantage of the ICM is that it responds flexibly to the individual learning needs of each student. It allows students to take their time reviewing the material at their own pace without getting left behind. The textbook used here encourages pupils to find their own solutions by explorative learning using the block-based programming environment MakeCode. Additional information to be uncovered by the learner is provided for every single step in the accompanying online wiki website. Results from observations showed that this uncover-function, being a central element of the online material, encouraged the learners to explore their own way in finding a solution with playful elements and increased motivation. The many haptic elements of a makerspace activity are in particular useful for consolidation of the learned and are predisposed for in-class work and deepening the understanding following the constructionism theory. A Design-Based Research (DBR) approach is used to create and evaluate the redesign of a proven example task in a pilot project. Teachers, who are already familiar with the BBC micro:bit and the OER textbook, were trained on how to use the “flip-version” of an example task in their lessons and asked to develop a lesson plan for implementation. The didactic approach to redesigning the material and teacher training was evaluated during the first cycle of DBR. Results from expert interviews showed that the redesigned material and training deliver a solid ground for rework and further research on a larger scale.",2377-634X,978-1-6654-3851-3,10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637170,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637170,microbit;inverted classroom;flipped classroom;makerspace;block-based programming;computational thinking;computer science,Training;Adaptation models;Streaming media;Time measurement;Online services;Distributed Bragg reflectors;Task analysis,,1.0,,39.0,IEEE,20 Dec 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Stealth assessment analyzes a stream of fine-grained student interaction data from a game-based learning environment to dynamically draw inferences about students' competencies through evidence-centered design. In evidence-centered design, evidence models have been traditionally designed using statistical rules authored by domain experts that are encoded using Bayesian networks. This article presents DeepStealth, a deep learning-based stealth assessment framework, that yields significant reductions in the feature engineering labor that has previously been required to create stealth assessments. DeepStealth utilizes end-to-end trainable deep neural network-based evidence models. Using this framework, evidence models are devised using a set of predictive features captured from raw, low-level interaction data to infer evidence for competencies. We investigate two deep learning-based evidence models, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and n-gram encoded feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). We compare these models' predictive performance for inferring students' knowledge to linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) and naïve Bayes models. We perform feature set-level analyses of game trace logs and external pre-learning measures, and we examine the models' early prediction capacity.

In this paper, the framework of CCEs is described, and the results of two separate studies on their impact on student achievement are presented. Students in introductory CS courses completed CCEs as part of those courses. Students in Study 1 came from a variety of programs, and students in Study 2 were engineering majors. A profiling approach was used to test whether the impact of the CCEs could be accounted for by differences in students' motivated and self-regulated engagement. Overall, CCEs had positive impacts on students' grades and knowledge test scores, and although there were differences in achievement across the profiles, the impact of the CCEs was generally consistent across profiles. The CCEs appear to be a promising way to increase student achievement in introductory CS courses.

However, crafting pedagogical HRI designs and robot interventions that have a real, positive impact on participants' learning, as well as effectively measuring such impact, is still an open challenge. As a first effort in tackling the issue, in this paper we propose a novel robot-mediated, collaborative problem solving activity for school children, called JUSThink, aiming at improving their computational thinking skills. JUSThink will serve as a baseline and reference for investigating how the robot's behaviour can influence the engagement of the children with the activity, as well as their collaboration and mutual understanding while working on it. To this end, this first iteration aims at investigating (i) participants' engagement with the activity (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory-IMI), their mutual understanding (IMIlike) and perception of the robot (Godspeed Questionnaire); (ii) participants' performance during the activity, using several performance and learning metrics. We carried out an extensive user-study in two international schools in Switzerland, in which around 100 children participated in pairs in one-hour long interactions with the activity. Surprisingly, we observe that while a teams' performance significantly affects how team members evaluate their competence, mutual understanding and task engagement, it does not affect their perception of the robot and its helpfulness, a fact which highlights the need for baseline studies and multi-dimensional evaluation metrics when assessing the impact of robots in educational activities.",1944-9437,978-1-7281-6075-7,10.1109/RO-MAN47096.2020.9223343,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223343,educational robotics;collaborative problem solving;computational thinking;engagement;mutual modelling;robot perception;human-robot interaction,Conferences;Humanoid robots;Collaboration;Particle measurements;Collaborative work;Task analysis;Robots,,10.0,,27.0,IEEE,14 Oct 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

With the nation's continuing shortage of scientists and engineers, there is an urgent need for diverse students, especially Hispanic students, to enter and complete science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education at all levels. Contributing factors to the low representation in STEM areas are the lack of Hispanic youth's exposure to engaging and relevant experiences with science in their early stages of development and the lack of Latino scientists as role models that are visible, tangible, real, and inspiring to their communities. In addition, student experiences in math and science in the middle grades have emerged as a “filter” that prevents many students from pursuing advanced STEM courses in high school and, therefore, limits their knowledge of and interest in exploring STEM subjects and careers later in their education. This paper presents a research-based approach to attract middle school students to STEM fields in a majority Hispanic region, using a game-based learning platform.

Informatics and computer sciences are continuously developing new information-storage devices and a multitude of software more rapidly than ever. However, effective information search and processing require an information literacy which the new generations characteristically, and more and more demonstrably, do not have. National and international empirical research proves that the algorithmic thinking of the younger generations, which is indispensable for the world of informatics, is underdeveloped when it comes to the effective and productive use of digital tools. Moreover, the phenomenon of hyper attention invades the everyday life and the learning habits of the younger generation to a greater and greater degree. The essence of the HY-DE model is to aid the students' learning process with the help of the teacher's purposeful control of the phases of attention (hyper, mixed and deep attention). One aim of the present study is to introduce a new application of the HY-DE model, entitled Data-Structure Validator HY-DE model (DaSVa HY-DE). In the introductory phase, the DaSVa model focuses on how the HY-DE attention-divisions manifest themselves in webpage-search as well as in the information retrieval that it yields, and what the roles of the hyper, mixed, and deep attention modes are in the development of computational thinking and algorithmic skills. In the full hyper attention status the search for specified contents is carried out, focusing on webpages which consist of data organized in table or table-like structures. The automated and semi-automated conversion of the webpages however requires the decreasing of hyper attention leading to deep or mixed attention. The final result of this conversion process is/are well-structured table(s) suitable for automated data retrieval in spreadsheets, database management, and programming. The application of the original HY-DE model would lead us to its modification. In the advanced phase of the DaSVa HY-DE model the students can also experience how the webpages are designed and structured, how they support information and data retrieval, how successful the algorithmic based retrieval can be, and how the approach would lead students to the application of the theory of well-structured webpage design. With this model, from the hyper attention data collection status, through a deep and/or mixed attention algorithm building and data analyzing process, students would reach a higher-level hyper attention, the developer status.",,978-1-5386-1264-4,10.1109/CogInfoCom.2017.8268242,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8268242,information literacy;computational thinking;hyper and deep attention;data structure;webpage conversion,Tools;Computational modeling;Education;Informatics;Data structures;Media;Software,,5.0,,18.0,IEEE,25 Jan 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

This paper presents a large scale study of the progression of the programming concepts practiced by Scratch users through an analysis of their complete public project portfolios. A dataset of over 112 thousand authors and their 1 million projects was constructed and analyzed from three viewpoints. First, we investigate the development of programming concepts by looking at block usage statistics for each project in the users' repositories. Second, we score and analyze the dataset using a computational thinking rubric. Third, we identify users that have left the Scratch platform and evaluate the learning goals they have achieved. Our results show that, while users progress in Scratch, there is a positive trend in the use of all concepts that were examined. Within the least utilized concepts, even after the 20th project of Scratch users, are procedures, conditional loops and logic operations. Examining the users who have left the Scratch platform after creating at least the mean amount of nine projects, we measured that half had left without ever utilizing procedures, and a third had left without ever utilizing conditional loops.",2165-9567,978-1-7281-8478-4,10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453973,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453973,Programming education;Scratch;Game development;Computational Thinking;K-12,Conferences;Games;Programming;Market research;Software;Trajectory;Engineering education,,4.0,,27.0,IEEE,18 Jun 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The covered topics in our proposal include (i) the use of temperature and humidity sensors for data collection, treatment and visualization using Arduino and micro-controllers; (ii) Smart and Human Cities (SHC) and Open Data concepts, in order to lead the students to reflect on the problems of their city and on data protection. Our motivation to our proposal is due to the educational processes have to develop criticality and the ability to solve problems among students. In this context, CT has been used for this through the use of robotics, game building or unplugged computing. On the other hand, technologies for implementing Internet of Things (IoT) have been used in several domains of society, including cities transformation. One important aspect in this scenario is data generation, which have to be carefully tackled by government's and who develop solutions to SHC. In this way, using IoT for teaching CT is an important aspect, also considering open data, privacy and SHC context. In our pedagogical practice, students were able to design and develop solutions to problems in their daily lives indirectly applying CT skills, such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, automation and analysis, as well as self-skills, collaboration, creativity and critically, required nowadays in broad professional training. It was also possible to develop students' interest in raising awareness of the use of computational technologies, as a solution to problems in society considering aspects of SHC and open data; propose a technological solution using IoT; and analyze the use of these data collected for the social well-being.

In some cases, simple activities involving coding might be even included at kindergartens attended by children from three years of age. The crucial aim is to develop the so-called computational thinking which is going to be more and more essential for a successful personal and professional development of every individual. There is a broad range of factors influencing the success of the change in the curriculum, which is, inter alia, supposed to include coding. In addition to the necessary teaching aids and know-how, teachers also need to have positive attitudes towards its implementation. The main objective of our research is to identify teachers' attitudes towards introducing coding to their classes. We discovered that not all teachers of computing agree with including algorithmization and coding in their teaching. Approximately one half of the questioned educators hold a negative attitude towards the curricular change; they would rather continue teaching computer user skills and basic programs. Their attitude proves to be an impediment to a successful curricular change as teachers should fully grasp the teaching content and communicate it with enthusiasm to their pupils. Insufficient knowledge is the key factor influencing teachers' negative attitudes towards the introduction of coding to schools.",,978-1-7281-3180-1,10.1109/Informatics47936.2019.9119333,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9119333,coding;school;teacher;computational thinking;pupil,,,3.0,,12.0,IEEE,17 Jun 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Therefore, adopting robotic learning with CT and AT can enhance learning skills over the conventional learning model. This paper presents a systematic literature review on CT and AT practices in robotics learning to improve educational methods. This study conducts a systematic literature review from four databases: ACM, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect. Sixty-five studies in robotics learning to increase CT and AT skills were analyzed by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study’s findings show that CT and AT are significant in training students to engage in robotics learning activities. These considerations will lead to strengthening their skill and critical thinking. The study also suggests that integrating these skills can prepare teachers for critical thinking and boost student learning. The findings suggest that CT and AT can directly adopt digital adversarial learning skills to improve overall robotics learning activities.

Seventeen pre-service teachers participated in this study conducted in the Computational Empowerment Lab at the Center of Teacher Education at the University of Vienna. The researchers aimed to identify specific improvement strategies for in-service and pre-service teachers to enhance their pedagogical practices in designing a robotic-coding camp by promoting student critical thinking, computational thinking, and problem-solving competencies. Additionally, the study proposed to identify the relevant features of the camp's design and implementation that can promote practitioners' engagement and address the challenges they face. The course was offered during the summer semester of 2023. For the procedure of the study, pre-service teachers thought about a problem or situation using the phenomena-based learning method and explained the problem using mediating tools, including educational robots, 3D printers, laser-cutting, and creative Lego boxes, among others. At the end of the course, students developed their project, designed a prototype of a robotic-coding camp, and created digital stories as real-world basis problem statements for their project. Students' assignments and group work interactions, including forum discussions in Moodle, reflection papers, and hands-on activities, were used as data sources. Data collected and analyzed by qualitatively. Participatory action research was used as a research method. The results provide guidelines for how to design and implement robotic coding camps and digital stories for teachers who might want to implement a robotic camp in their future careers.

Despite the potential of predictive modelling in providing timely adaptive learning and gameplay experience, there is a lack of research on the early prediction of learners’ performance in educational games. In this research, we propose an early predictive modelling approach, called GameEPM, to estimate learners’ final scores in an educational game for promoting computational thinking. Specifically, the GameEPM approach models the sequence of learners’ actions and then uses a limited sequence of the actions to predict the final score of the game for each learner. The findings from our initial trials show that our approach can accurately and robustly estimate the learners’ performance at the early stages of the game. Using less than 50% of learners’ action sequences, the cross-validated deep learning model achieves a squared correlation higher than 0.8 with a relative error of less than 8%, outperforming a range of regression models like linear regression, random forest, neural networks, and support vector machines. An additional experiment showed that the validated deep learning model can also achieve high performance while tested on an independent game dataset, showing its applicability and robustness in real-world cases. Comparing the results with traditional machine learning methods revealed that, in the validation and application phases, up to 0.30 and 0.35 R2 gain is achieved in favor of the deep learning model, respectively. Finally, we found that while the lengths of action sequences influence the predictive power of the traditional machine learning methods, this effect is not substantial in the deep learning model.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3249286,National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Korean Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2021R1C1C2004868); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10054028,Early performance prediction;learner model;educational games;computational thinking;deep learning,Games;Predictive models;Performance evaluation;Machine learning;Adaptation models;Deep learning;Computational modeling;Education;Learning systems,,1.0,,41.0,CCBYNCND,27 Feb 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

The difficulties vary from subject to subject. Teachers' first challenge in Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking teaching is their technological literacy and competency challenges. Lack of confidence, time, and willingness are significant reasons for the challenge. One of the studies on mathematics teaching shows that teachers need more knowledge tools and models to facilitate the analysis during the teaching process. Researchers assert that educational practice has focused more on technology than on new pedagogies needed to truly use technology in a transformative way. Frameworks are designed to meet high-level objectives set by the authorities. Teachers are provided with teaching materials for developing the course contents. The frameworks act as a connection between high-level objectives and low-level teaching materials. In this paper, we present the elaboration of a framework for teaching CS at the early stages of education. The framework consists of three components based on modelling real-world problems into a machine-world context and then realising the machine solution in the real world. Moreover, the problem-solving component of the framework emphasizes the iterative process of learning that strengthens the previous concepts and provides a logical con-nection between the previous and new concepts. The framework was evaluated in the context of Saudi Arabia, where the teachers were interviewed individually and then provided with a guide for teaching grade-4 learners. The guide was developed using the material provided by the Saudi Ministry of Education. The teachers taught using this guide over a sequence of lessons. At the end of this time, a second individual teacher interview was conducted to determine teacher experience. The results show that teaching using the framework is effective, and it is not only easier for teachers to understand the teaching method but also for learners to learn the content quickly.",2377-634X,979-8-3503-3642-9,10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342646,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342646,K-12;Computer Science Education;Computational Thinking,Computer science;Surveys;Computational modeling;Education;Mathematical models;Problem-solving;Iterative methods,,,,39.0,IEEE,5 Jan 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Therefore, the objectives of this study are to evaluate the effectiveness of such a computing curriculum in improving the learning of computational thinking concepts (CTCs: flow control, data representation, abstraction, user-interactivity, synchronization, parallelism, and logic) by comparing computing projects developed by two groups of students (Potential Development Middle School (PDMS) and Rich Center for Autism (RCA)) of twenty-one students with ASD and by investigating the progressive improvement of a total of 312 computing projects developed by students (138 in PDMS and 174 in RCA) over 20 sessions. Students in both groups were equal in their knowledge of CTCs at the pretest, and RCA and PDMS groups were taught utilizing the accessible and original CT curriculums, respectively, in this experimental study. The results showed that the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective in learning of logic. Additionally, when all seven CTCs as a single construct were examined, the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective than the accessible one. Furthermore, an investigation of the gradual increase in students' computing project scores throughout 20 sessions showed that both curriculums were statistically significantly effective in progressively improving students' learning of data representation, abstraction, synchronization, parallelism, and all CTCs as a single construct.

The fundamental concept behind Bayes’ theorem revolves around comprehending the degree of truth within the confines of an explicit perspective. This involves partitioning the entire sample space of possible evidence and utilizing the subset containing the relevant perspective to estimate the uncertainty of an event or the reliability of a model.

Research indicates that students, irrespective of their educational level, face difficulties in grasping fundamental concepts in mechanics of materials. These challenges arise from the inherent complexity of concepts like stress, strain, torsion, and buckling, which are difficult to observe, hindering comprehension. Therefore, this work aims to leverage the synergy between mechanics of materials and computational principles to actively engage students in advanced topics such as structural strength, failure of structures, and sensitivity analysis, through the use of computational notebooks. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we first asked students to analyze truss structures using hand calculations following the discrete stiffness method within a Finite Element Analysis framework. Subsequently, we implemented the same method as a simulation tool in a MATLAB Computational Notebook. Finally, we asked the students to reflect on: (1) the value of using computational methods to approach Finite Element Analysis when compared to hand calculations; (2) the difficulties they faced when implementing the activities in the MATLAB Computational Notebook; (3) the support they required to successfully complete these activities; and (4) the effectiveness of the simulation tool in understanding the effect of forces and stress distributions in structures. We anticipate that computational notebooks will provide an ideal platform for sharing lessons and tutorials, enhancing student engagement, and promoting active learning.

Python was selected to conduct the analysis because of its popularity and utility in the broader engineering field. Early exposure to this highly desired engineering skill can provide added benefits to students. Combining Python with an engaging lab experience can have a compounding effect on student learning outcomes. A five-week Python-based lab module was developed for an introductory thermal-fluid science class. The module reinforced fundamental concepts learned in lecture, while expanding on design-related analysis which is often left for advanced courses. The lab module began with an introduction to Python programming and quickly transitioned to the parametric analysis of standard Rankine, Gas Turbine, and Vapor Compression cycles. The lab module was designed to be self-guided with step-by-step instructions presented using Google Colab. This paper details the implementation and the student outcomes. Both direct and indirect assessments were conducted over two semesters of the course. Results indicate a strong positive impact on Python programming learning outcomes. Students acquired a working knowledge of Python programming and experienced how computational tools can be used to solve advanced engineering problems. At the same time, the student feedback indicated students' resistance to open-ended projects and independent learning; even if they are aware of their relevance and benefits to their future careers.

Improving teaching materials for computing education is in line with the conference theme “Creating a convergence in engineering education and workforce development”. In this research, coding sheets are used as a part of the teaching materials, and the assessment tools are used to assess the algorithmic thinking ability of the students. The assumption here is that there is a mutual impact between the improvement of teaching materials and that of assessment tools. This kind of strategy is important, especially in the setting of elementary school education in Japan in which conducting a pilot study is difficult. In Japan, the new curriculum guidelines were fully implemented in April 2020 in elementary schools and in April 2021 in junior high schools respectively. They will be implemented in April 2022 in high schools. Since the announcement of the new curriculum guidelines, the boards of education in the local governments have been preparing for the programming education in the schools. However, there are still remaining problems, including the shortage of trained teachers and the lack of good assessment tools. In order to remedy the shortage of trained teachers, we designed some coding sheets for the teaching materials consisting of block parts, servo motors, DC-motors, LEDs, and sensors. In our assessment tools which are supposed to assess students' Computational Thinking ability, we included only the questions for assessing algorithmic thinking ability, as there is a limited amount of time for the assessment in schools.

An Advanced Intrusion Detection System for IIoT Based on GA and Tree Based Algorithms,S. M. Kasongo,"Department of Industrial Engineering, Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch, South Africa",IEEE Access,18 Aug 2021,2021,9.0,,113199,113212,"The evolution of the Internet and cloud-based technologies have empowered several organizations with the capacity to implement large-scale Internet of Things (IoT)-based ecosystems, such as Industrial IoT (IIoT). The IoT and, by virtue, the IIoT, are vulnerable to new types of threats and intrusions because of the nature of their networks. So it is crucial to develop Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that can provide the security, privacy, and integrity of IIoT networks. In this research, we propose an IDS for IIoT that was implemented using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection, and the Random Forest (RF) model was employed in the GA fitness function. The models used for the intrusion detection processes include classifiers such as the RF, Linear Regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Extra-Trees (ET), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). The GA-RF generated 10 feature vectors for the binary classification scheme and 7 feature vectors for the multiclass classification procedure. The UNSW-NB15 is used to assess the effectiveness and the robustness of our proposed approach. The experimental outcomes demonstrated that for the binary modeling process, the GA-RF achieved a test accuracy (TAC) of 87.61% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, using a feature vector that contained 16 features.

Human sleep is often modelled on the four sleep stages and the deep sleep stage is employed in this work. The mathematical model of sleep homeostatic pressure is employed to simulate and determine the deep sleep state. The performance of DSO is demonstrated by employing 23 traditional functions (i.e., unimodal, multimodal, and fixed multi-modal functions), six composite functions, three engineering design problems, two knapsack problems, and six widely known travelling salesman’s problems. Additionally, the performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, computational running time, the Wilcoxon rank sum, and the Friedman test.

We characterize the EI using a classical mathematical method while considering the power density, the SAR, the electric field strength, and the tissue's density and conductivity. As such, a novel exposure-index open-loop power control algorithm is proposed to evaluate the realistic RF-EMF radiation exposure on human users from both the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) communication devices. To solve an EI minimization problem using the open-loop power control algorithm, we formulate it in the form of a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. As the energy capacity (i.e., power density) in wireless networks determines the radiation exposure (SAR and EI), it minimizes the EI by controlling and managing the transmitted and received powers under the restrictions of Quality of Service (QoS), interference, and power, while ensuring the users' QoS requirements are met. Our proposed scheme is numerically compared to other heuristic algorithms and exposure limits established by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and other similar organizations. Lastly, we compare the emissions from 4G and 5G networks to the emissions from UL and DL transmissions. Our simulation findings indicate that our proposed technique is a good alternative.

However, intruders find such complex and distributed infrastructures appealing targets for cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are severe threats that can jeopardize the quality of service provided to clients and compromise data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Cyber-attacks are becoming more complex, making it more challenging to detect intrusions effectively. Due to the high traffic and increased malicious activities on the Internet, a single Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be overwhelmed. Despite the various Deep Learning (DL) approaches that have been proposed as alternative solutions, there are still pertinent security issues to be addressed especially in federated cloud computing domains. This work proposes a Secure Federated Intrusion Detection Model Version 1 (SecFedIDM-V1) using blockchain technology and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The Cobourg Intrusion Detection Dataset (CIDDS) was acquired, pre-processed and split into 60:20:20, 70:15:15, and 80:10:10 for training, testing, and validation respectively to develop the proposed intrusion traffic classification component of the proposed model. The developed SecFedIDM-V1 was later deployed as a Python-based web application that captures network packets for classifying attacks into normal or an attack type. The attack packets are recorded in a Hyperledger Fabric (a private blockchain technology) to serve as a signature database to be used by other nodes in the network. From the evaluation results of the intrusion classifier, the 80:10:10 BiLSTM network performed better than GRU with a Precision of 0.99624, Recall of 0.99906, F1 Score of 0.99614, False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.00094, False Negative Rate (FNR) of 0.00395 and True Positive Rate (TPR) of 0.99605.

Based on an inductive analysis of one-on-one interviews, surveys, and weekly observations, we provide insights into students' motivations, career goals, perceptions of programming, and reactions to the Java and Processing languages. One of our key findings is that between the traditional classification of non-programmers vs. programmers, there exists a category of conversational programmers who do not necessarily want to be professional programmers or even end-user programmers, but want to learn programming so that they can speak in the “programmer's language” and improve their perceived job marketability in the software industry.",,978-1-4673-7457-6,10.1109/VLHCC.2015.7357224,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357224,Computer science education;computational thinking;programming for non-CS majors,Programming profession;Education,,27.0,,28.0,IEEE,17 Dec 2015,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In this context, the “Riconnessioni” project was promoted by the Compagnia di San Paolo in agreement with the Ministry of Education but planned, started and developed by the Foundation for the School. The digital transformation started with a defined strategy that leveraged opportunities presented by new technology while meeting the objectives of system stakeholders. Through several steps, that strategy was developed for education connecting everything to support tomorrow’s digital world and creating strong strategic partnerships able to build an ecosystem connecting people, processes, and things into a powerful, secure, and smart communications network. This paper reports on the three-year Riconnessioni project, which is combining the energies of teachers, managers, administrative staff, students, among others, and experimenting with new learning models, taking advantage of opportunities that emerged from perceptions stemming from concerns and systemic issues. To date, more than 150 schools in Italy have been included in the project, together with 550 teachers selected to scale up the instructional process. Using a methodology called “cascade training”, the 550 selected teachers were able to spread the knowledge to more than 2,600 colleagues. The monitoring and evaluation activity performed in Riconnessioni aims at processing information on implementation and results, following three lines. First, it regularly evaluates project activities from a reporting standpoint. Second, it verifies the plan consistency against implementation achievements. Third, it identifies changes produced and focuses on teachers’ and students’ skills to evaluate the effects of the project. The assessment framework is also discussed in this work, reporting on results regarding feedback, follow-up, and effects gathered from the field. The evaluation highlighted that labs were indeed able to improve teachers’ competence and underlined the added value of cascade training which spread digital domain knowledge and awareness into the group of involved schools.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3018189,Compagnia di San Paolo Foundation; Foundation for the School; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9172001,Digital transformation;adaptive learning;computational thinking;computer science;education;information technologies;primary school;secondary school,Digital transformation;Training;Biological system modeling;Business;Cloud computing;Collaboration,,26.0,,68.0,CCBY,20 Aug 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

The learning design was based on situated learning accompanied by a mix of tutorials, teacher explanations and support & collaboration amongst the students. The results of the first iteration of Design-Based Research confirmed the hypotheses that video game development was fascinating and engaging for the majority of young learners.

From the first cycle of game development we learned that dealing with the complexity of the development environment in a systematic way, time management, advanced teachers' competencies in handling the environment, and providing well balanced learning materials are crucial to successfully employ a professional tool like Unity in secondary education. Besides improved materials and a stepwise process of adding complexity e.g. by starting with developing mini-games, the most important change for the second cycle is to significantly extend the time allocated for game development.

Developing a Critical Robot Literacy for Young People from Conceptual Metaphors Analysis,B. Fanny; H. Julie; C. Anne-Sophie,"Research Institute in didactic and Education at UNamur, University of Namur, Belgium; Namur Digital Institute, University of Namur, Belgium; Namur Digital Institute, University of Namur, Belgium",2020 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),4 Dec 2020,2020,,,1,7,"This Research-to-Practice Full Paper presents a reflective analysis of robotic literacy activities focused on children and teenagers. Robotic literacy is integrated or being integrated into the education system for children at an early age all around the world. Most of the teachers in charge of this education lack skills and are left to fend for themselves. This study proposes to focus on the discourses made by teachers and learners during such activities, and especially the metaphors used spontaneously. It takes shape through two robotic literacy activities. The first activity involved the robots BeeBot, BlueBot and Ozobot in seven classes of children from 3 to 10 years old. The second activity consisted of a five half-days training for 13 participants from 8 to 15 years old. They designed, built and programmed a robot. Young people's representations and interactions with robots involved in educational activities are observed to contribute to the development of questions for critical technology education. Analyses are carried out using the conceptual metaphor theory of Lakoff and Jonhson. Three roles are identified: the metaphor that helps to understand, the metaphor that makes tangible, and the metaphor that serves as a catchphrase. A metaphor can take more than one role and, whatever its role, can be classified as a living or non-living metaphor. Using living metaphors may hide aspects of the machine and raises ethical issues, inter alia. It is then essential to deconstruct young people's representations of the machine.

With the above motivation, we conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with instructors who teach introductory programming courses and we also collected diaries kept by 110 students during their studies. The qualitative analysis of these data revealed connections between the studied contents such as dependencies. Our analysis shows that many difficulties arise from the incorrect application of the knowledge necessary in learning new content, usually because the student has not learned earlier topics or learned them superficially.

Factors that contribute to the complexity of this activity include: (1) recognizing patterns within an algorithm, (2) mapping the understanding of an algorithm to the syntax of a given programming language, and (3) complexity intrinsic to the problem domain itself. Cognitive load theory states that learning outcomes can be positively affected by reducing the extraneous cognitive load associated with learning objectives as well as by changing the nature of what is learned. In the study reported upon here, a novel instructional method was developed to decrease students' cognitive load. Novel instructional content supported by a custom visualization tool was used in a classroom setting in order to help novice programmers develop an understanding of function-based problem decomposition within the context of a visual domain.

However, there is a shortage of K-12 teachers with the background, preparation, and experience necessary to teach CS. To build capacity to deliver this instruction, districts must provide teacher preparation that includes not only CS content, but also high-quality pedagogical approaches that will meet the needs of all students enrolled in a wide variety of school settings. In this paper, we explore teacher outcomes across multiple CS professional development opportunities, in one large urban district. The teacher outcomes were measured via a survey administered between eight months and two years after teachers received training to implement CS. Though our findings are from a single district, we believe these findings are relevant to other settings and provide useful information about the outcomes of teacher professional development for CS education, as well as supports and barriers to implementing CS, in a large, urban school system. The results offer insight into professional development quality, teacher confidence, the ability of teachers to implement CS in their classrooms, and supports and barriers to offering CS instruction (even in a district where CS education is a priority). They also shed light on how supports and barriers differ in schools serving students with high economic needs and lower academic performance compared with schools serving students with lower economic needs and higher academic performance. These differences underscore the importance of considering economic need and academic performance (in addition to race and gender) when developing and executing CS for all initiatives.",,978-1-7281-7172-2,10.1109/RESPECT49803.2020.9272418,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272418,CS4All;K-12 classroom implementation;Teacher survey;Evaluation;Assessment;Computational Thinking;Gender and Diversity;Teacher Development;K-12 Curriculum;K-12 Instruction;Non-traditional Students;Professional Practice,Training;Urban areas;Economics;Encoding;Software engineering;STEM;Programming profession,,2.0,,19.0,IEEE,4 Dec 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

This is due to the massive presence of programmable elements ranging from computers to toys. Because of this, the interest of researchers on this topic has increased. Questions, such as what to use, in what educational stages to use it, the effectiveness of the method, and the focal objectives for learning programming are questions that do not have obvious answers. Research Questions: 1) What empirical evidence exists on the use of educational programming languages (EPLs)? 2) In what context is the research performed? 3) How is effectiveness reported in the literature after applying EPLs? 4) What pedagogical goals are achieved by using EPLs? Methodology: Following a formal protocol, automated searches were performed for primary studies from 2007 to 2018. A total of 62 studies were identified, of which 29 were selected and analyzed since they include some type of empirical evidence. Findings: After performing the evaluation, the results support the need for better approaches with empirical evidence when reporting research on the usage of EPLs.

Developing a Real World Escape Room for Assessing Preexisting Debugging Experience of K12 Students,T. Michaeli; R. Romeike,"Computing Education Research Group, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Computing Education Research Group, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany",2021 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON),18 Jun 2021,2021,,,521,529,"Debugging code is a central skill in learning to program. Nevertheless, debugging poses a major hurdle in the K12 classroom, as students are often rather helpless and rely on the teacher hurrying from one student-PC to the other. Despite this, debugging is an underrepresented topic in the classroom as well as in computer science education research, as only few studies, materials and concepts discuss the explicit teaching of debugging. According to the constructivist learning theory, teaching and developing concepts and materials for the classroom have to take learners' preexisting experience into account. Students' preexisting debugging experience is built through troubleshooting, where they frequently find and fix errors in their daily lives - before they learn to program - for example when repairing their bicycle or if “the internet” stops working. Debugging is a special case of general troubleshooting and shares common characteristics, such as the overall process or particular strategies. Thus, the aim of this study is to develop an instrument for assessing preexisting debugging experience in the form of a real-world escape room consisting of debugging-related troubleshooting tasks. This allows us to observe students' troubleshooting process, strategies, and overall behavior in a natural environment and thus assess preexisting debugging experience. To this end, a design-based research process was conducted and a real-world escape room consisting of various troubleshooting tasks was developed. Those tasks and the escape room setting provide an innovative methodological approach to study students troubleshooting behavior and assess their preexisting debugging experience.",2165-9567,978-1-7281-8478-4,10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453972,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453972,debugging;troubleshooting;escape room;computer science education;K12;computational thinking,Systematics;Instruments;Conferences;Debugging;Bicycles;Computer science education;Task analysis,,1.0,,47.0,IEEE,18 Jun 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Robofest is a worldwide robotics competition program for students in 4th-12th grade and college. Student teams design, construct, and program their autonomous robots in a variety of competition categories. In the 2019–2020 academic year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we designed an innovative and novel online robotics competition format using Zoom Webinar tools rather than cancelling the world championship competition. The purpose of this paper is to show how we designed, implemented synchronized online robotics competitions, and to analyze the results and efficacy of the Robofest Online World championships (ROWC). One hundred and fifty-three teams comprising of 360 students competed in three age divisions and six categories held weekends from Aug. 28 through Oct. 10, 2020. Most teams set up playing fields at home and we trained judges online prior to the competitions. We sent the description of an unknown game ending task and unknown playing field factors to local volunteer judges at the same time just before the 30-minute work time on the competition day. After checking to make sure that all the teams were ready to play, we sent the game start signal to all the teams at the same time through Zoom. The local judges scored the runs and submitted videos to the Robofest office for score verification. Robofest office staff also proctored the competitions through Zoom screens for fair competition results and maximum learning opportunities. It was an innovative practice of using online conference tools to organize the world's first unique “synchronized” online autonomous robotics competitions for engineering and computing education. Anonymous coach & judge survey results after the ROWC showed that the satisfaction rate was better than the in-person competition surveys of previous years. Additionally, 95 % of students surveyed after the ROWC exposure said that they would now consider a career involving STEM versus 91 % of students surveyed after the 2019 in-person competitions.",2377-634X,978-1-6654-3851-3,10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637399,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637399,online robotics competition;autonomous robotics;computational thinking;computer science and engineering education;virtual robotics;online learning environment;STEM education;synchronized online competition;online competition methodologies,Pandemics;Engineering profession;Education;Games;Webinars;Synchronization;Task analysis,,,,17.0,IEEE,20 Dec 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Polar Codes: Speed of Polarization and Polynomial Gap to Capacity,V. Guruswami; P.

Polar coding gives the first known explicit construction with rigorous proofs of all these properties; previous constructions were not known to achieve capacity with less than  $\exp (1/ \varepsilon )$  decoding complexity except for erasure channels. We establish the capacity-achieving property of polar codes via a direct analysis of the underlying martingale of conditional entropies, without relying on the martingale convergence theorem. This step gives rough polarization (noise levels  $\approx \varepsilon $  for the good channels), which can then be adequately amplified by tracking the decay of the channel Bhattacharyya parameters. Our effective bounds imply that polar codes can have block length (and encoding/decoding complexity) bounded by a polynomial in  $1/ \varepsilon $ . The generator matrix of such polar codes can be constructed in polynomial time by algorithmically computing an adequate approximation of the polarization process.",1557-9654,,10.1109/TIT.2014.2371819,"Packard Fellowship; MSR-CMU Center for Computational Thinking; NSF(grant numbers:CCF-0963975,CCF-1422045); NSF Graduate Fellowship; ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6960872,Information theory;error-correction codes;linear codes;Channel polarization;entropy;maximum likelihood decoding;symmetric capacity,Decoding;Error probability;Polynomials;Entropy;Convergence;Complexity theory;Capacity planning,,53.0,,32.0,IEEE,20 Nov 2014,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
Capacity of Non-Malleable Codes,M. Cheraghchi; V. Guruswami,"Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, U.K.; Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,12 Feb 2016,2016,62.0,3.0,1097,1118,"Non-malleable codes, introduced by Dziembowski et al., encode messages s in a manner, so that tampering the codeword causes the decoder to either output s or a message that is independent of s. While this is an impossible goal to achieve against unrestricted tampering functions, rather surprisingly non-malleable coding becomes possible against every fixed family P of tampering functions that is not too large (for instance, when I≤I 22αn for some α <; 1, where n is the number of bits in a codeword). In this paper, we study the capacity of non-malleable codes, and establish optimal bounds on the achievable rate as a function of the family size, answering an open problem from Dziembowski et al. Specifically, We prove that for every family P with IFI I≤I 22αn, there exist non-malleable codes against P with rate arbitrarily close to 1-α [this is achieved with high probability (w.h.p.) by a randomized construction]. We show the existence of families of size exp(nO(1)2αn) against which there is no non-malleable code of rate 1 - α (in fact this is the case w.h.p for a random family of this size). We also show that 1 - α is the best achievable rate for the family of functions, which are only allowed to tamper the first αn bits of the codeword, which is of special interest. As a corollary, this implies that the capacity of non-malleable coding in the split-state model (where the tampering function acts independently but arbitrarily on the two halves of the codeword, a model which has received some attention recently) equals 1/2. We also give an efficient Monte Carlo construction of codes of rate close to 1 with polynomial time encoding and decoding that is non-malleable against any fixed c > 0 and family P of size 2nc, in particular tampering functions with, say, cubic size circuits.",1557-9654,,10.1109/TIT.2015.2511784,Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(grant numbers:PA00P2-141980); MSR-CMU Center for Computational Thinking; National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-0963975); Packard Fellowship; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7365445,Cryptography;cryptographic protocols;codes;privacy;data security;Cryptography;cryptographic protocols;codes;privacy;data security,Encoding;Decoding;Monte Carlo methods;Computer science;Cryptography;Electronic mail;Probabilistic logic,,14.0,,19.0,IEEE,24 Dec 2015,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

However, most restrict access to the outside world, limiting learners to commands and computing resources built in to the environment. Some allow learners to drag and drop files, connect to sensors and robots locally or issue HTTP requests. But in a world where most of the applications in our daily lives are distributed (i.e., their functionality depends on communicating with other programs or accessing resources and data on the internet), the lack of support for beginners to envision and create such distributed programs is a lost opportunity. This paper argues that it is not only feasible, but crucial, to create environments with simple yet powerful abstractions that open up distributed computing and other widely used but advanced computing concepts including networking, the Internet of Things, and cybersecurity to novices. By thus removing the walls around our environments, we can expand opportunities for learning considerably: programs can access a wealth of online data and web services, and communicate with other projects. Moreover, these changes can enable young learners to collaborate with each other during program construction whether they share their physical location or study remotely. Importantly, providing access to the wider world will also help counter widespread student perceptions that block-based environments are mere toys, and show that they are capable of creating compelling applications.

Therefore, it becomes imperative to understand their behavior to examine potential pitfalls.

The findings of this review highlight that it is premature to incorporate these systems into computing education due to their limitations that may limit their effectiveness as comprehensive coding assistants for computer science students.

Young peoples' decisions about participation often start early and have been linked to particular experiences [2]. For some young people, these experiences are less than encouraging. In the US, high school computer science courses are overwhelmingly male dominated [3]. Schools serving minority students and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds often struggle to even offer such classes [4]. Even when opportunities exist, many girls and underrepresented populations face barriers such as negative stereotypes and dearth of role models and community [5]. The Digital Youth Divas program was created to address these issues through intentional design. The program is developed to trigger situational interest [6] in girls through a combination of community, project-based instruction, on- and offline learning spaces, and narrative stories. Triggered situational interest is critical as an opening to move on to subsequent phases that are more independent of environmental factors. Understanding potential effective triggers for girls, minorities, and youth from lower socioeconomic backgrounds is critical to engaging such populations in STEM learning. (1) Community: Middle school girls interested in fashion and design are recruited, especially from areas that have traditionally been underserved. Adult mentors who are not engineers, but share cultural connections with the girls and have gone through curriculum and pedagogical training, attend to specific practices of encouraging, helping to troubleshoot, and developing community. (2) Project-based instruction: The program combines principles of fashion, design, and dance with the power and possibilities of electronic circuits and programming to develop interactive e-fashion projects and virtual programmed choreographies. Scaffolded challenges work through stages of design and computational thinking, including paper prototyping, implementation, feedback, and revision. (3) Integrated on and offline learning spaces: Girls work through projects in a shared physical space using supplied materials. An online system, iRemix, is the mechanism for independent work and leveling up. (4) Interactive narrative stories: Narratives can provide context that helps relate abstract concepts to real-world issues [7], increase motivation and positively contribute to girls' science identity [8], and provide focus for design by communicating tasks, specifically when readers can identify with the stories [9]. Compelling stories conveyed in text and multimedia (video, audio, images) is employed to engage middle school girls in activities involving computational thinking. The stories center on a group of middle school girls involved in the Digital Youth Divas program, and combines aspects of contemporary young adult fiction (mystery, social and emotional issues) with content, topics, and project work from the e-textiles and programming curricula. The interactive narratives unfold through the iRemix platform: girls launch narratives and at intervals are prompted to engage in project-based work. The girls solve challenges by submitting work online, and receive and respond to messages from characters. Our early exploratory research suggested that narratives prompted discussions of identity, and contributed to participant interest in the program content and motivation to engage in project work.",,978-1-5090-0151-4,10.1109/RESPECT.2015.7296518,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7296518,,Physics;Statistics;Sociology;Computational modeling;User experience;Training;Textiles,,6.0,,,IEEE,12 Oct 2015,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The use of computing software has become ubiquitous and a working knowledge of data science has become increasingly essential for researchers in all domains. However, curriculum development focusing on imparting foundational programming skills and fundamentals of data science for researchers in domains other than computing has been scarce. Thus, there is an unmet need for curriculum development involving computational thinking, programming, and the fundamentals of data science for this audience. Recognizing these growing needs and demands of researchers to learn programming and data science that can then be applied to their area of research or practice, we developed an introductory course in programming and data science for PDRs in biology and medicine. The primary goal of the course was to develop computational thinking skills in PDRs who hail from backgrounds that have traditionally not focused on inculcating computational thinking. This course covered the fundamental concepts of programming using either Python or R - languages that researchers outside the computing community use in numerous ways including the statistical analysis of large datasets that are becoming increasingly common in biomedical research. Further, PDRs enrolled in the course were introduced to some of the broad categories of problems in data science - exploratory data analysis, classification, regression, and clustering - along with relevant algorithms and how they can be applied to real-world datasets in their respective domains using packages or libraries in Python or R. We also report the feedback from the enrolled PDRs, lessons learned, and recommendations for instructors interested in designing similar curricula.

The research findings that we report are threefold. First, we report on how we fostered building programming concepts into the curriculum into a set of activities specifically designed for an immigrant engineer retraining program with students ranging in backgrounds. We found that at that the program curriculum must be flexible enough for student learning regardless of the fact that a student may miss sessions. Second, we report on how an effective pedagogical environment, which fosters student-centered learning, was promoted so that the students could construct their own meanings of the programming concepts. Third, we report on implementation strategies unique to a retraining program, such as specific environmental constraints as well as how sessions were partitioned into components that fostered computational thinking while learning Java.

Enculturation of Students to Engineering and COVID's Impact Associated,N. V. Mendoza Diaz; A. M. Esparza; K. E. Rambo-Hernandez; B.

Enculturation can be understood as the process by which students are assimilated into the engineering culture. This culture involves the base knowledge, practices, and values shared by the community of practicing engineers. Both the culture and its assimilation are somewhat obscure and often attributed to role-modeling and hidden curriculum. Nevertheless, undergraduate students are expected to undergo this assimilation process, and by the end of a five-year program, they behave, talk, and do what engineers do. An approach to this process is the well-established model of engineering identity. This model of identity, however, limits its scope to the intrinsic process occurring in the student without paying much attention to the support systems expected to welcome and nurture students into the profession. Enculturation is a relatively new model that proposes both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting this assimilation of students. During the Spring of 2022, a team of researchers at a U.S. Southwest institution applied a survey to operationalize the extrinsic factors of a recently outlined engineering model of enculturation to understand the impact of COVID on engineering students. Eight Likert-based questions were asked to 534 engineering undergraduate students at different school year classifications (e.g., sophomore, junior, or senior). The model of enculturation tested eight extrinsic factors involving (1) engineering design, (2) teamwork, (3) engineering profession, (4) ethics, (5) engineering communications, (6) mathematical/physical modeling, (7) problem-solving, and (8) algorithmic/computational thinking. Additional Likert-based questions asked students about the perceived impact of COVID on their educational experience. The research questions guiding their investigation were: (a) How are the dimensions of enculturation to engineering changing across engineering undergraduate classifications?, and (b) How is enculturation associated with the COVID impact on students? Preliminary results show that six of the factors (namely 1–5 and 7) increase by students' school classification. This means that students in the lower years of their undergraduate program perceive their enculturation, as portrayed by factors 1–5 & 7, less than students at more advanced stages of their program. In terms of the perceived impact of COVID, only two factors showed negative correlations with this perceived impact The factors were ethics and algorithmic/computational thinking. In other words, the worse the student's perception of COVID's impact on their educational experience, the less they endorsed their enculturation in the impact of society of their technical solutions and their use of programming languages. While these results show encouraging applicability of the enculturation model, it can only be considered a first approach to a more fully developed model. The researchers expect to engage the FIE community in a discussion leading to a more refined enculturation model.",2377-634X,979-8-3503-3642-9,10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343256,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343256,Enculturation to engineering;COVID impact;curriculum,COVID-19;Surveys;Knowledge engineering;Ethics;Organizations;Mathematical models;Teamwork,,,,13.0,USGov,5 Jan 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

However, introducing programming at such an early stage presents unique challenges, given the need for students to grasp mathematical concepts, abstract thinking, and the intricacies of programming syntax. Educational Data Mining (EDM) offers a potential contribution by predicting learning performance, facilitating the optimization of the learning processes, and providing real-time guidance. A notable gap in the current literature about EDM in programming education is its predominant emphasis on the university level. Our research objectives were to identify features influencing primary school students' programming capabilities. A more comprehensive dataset was introduced, incorporating psychometric data and highlighting features such as learning motivation and attitude, computational thinking data, and other potentially influential variables, which set our study apart from previous studies. We found that the strongest predictor was academic performance in Information Technology, followed by psychometric data on students' learning attitudes and motivation. Computational thinking also emerged as a significant feature in predicting programming performance. It's worth highlighting that involvement in extra-curricular activities, like Olympic Mathematics training, showed a significant association, underscoring the importance of mathematical logic and reasoning in programming.

One such Either-Or binary that is relevant to our project so far is computing vs. computational thinking.2 A keynote address delivered recently at a computing education conference by the computer scientist and educator Judy Robertson is quite illuminating in this respect.3 Robertson argued against a blind emphasis on computational “thinking” as the centerpiece of computational literacy. Focusing only on creating SCRATCH programs may lead especially young learners away from understanding how the computer actually works as a “machine.” Children's drawings of what is inside a computer show that learning to use computational abstractions that we typically introduce in the K-12 levels—such as variables and loops—does not necessarily help us understand how these abstractions are processed and represented inside the computer. What gets lost in our push to teach children how to code is the physicality of computing as a machine, which involves a deeper understanding of the relationship between the hardware and software—and many other forms of computational abstractions that are not even presented to children as part of their experience of coding or computing.",,9780262363075,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9388156.pdf&bkn=9382289&pdfType=chapter,,,,,,,,29 Mar 2021,,,MIT Press,MIT Press eBook Chapters

In response, there has been growing attention in research and practice emphasizing pre-college groups. This is partly because of the growing recognition-reflected in initiatives like CS4ALL, Code.org, Bootstrap: Data Science, Exploring Computer Science-that learning experiences before college are consequential in sustaining a robust pipeline of computer scientists and engineers. Despite these inroads, there is justifiable concern that existing efforts might not fully support learner development in the necessary conceptual, epistemological, and heuristic styles needed to productively parse and understand “big data.” This is because computing-based curricula that include data science often involve data curated by others (rather than learners directly), which results in simulated versions of practice instead of engagement that is realistically discursive and messy. This is further complicated by the persistent shortage of K-12 computer science teachers in general and even fewer who can design and implement curricula that support authentic engagement with data science. To address these issues, we leverage culturally relevant and constructionist perspectives in a sandbox (i.e., open-ended) science where tools like Scratch and electronic textiles (E-textiles) have had success expanding possibilities in computing to also include activities where learners can engage broadly along varied pursuits-and encounter challenges that spur computational thinking and problem-solving. The literature suggests that learning activities framed in this way encourage knowledge construction, practice literacies, and seriously impact learner attitudes, interest, and perceptions of growth in the field. This latter set of self-concept measures represents a few of many related key predictors of long-term field participation and persistence. In this work-in-progress scholarship of discovery research, we co-develop, with youth and educators, “Coding Like a Data Miner” (CLDM)-a sandbox approach to computing-based data science wherein learners access a social media platform, Twitter, to mine, analyze, and understand quantitative and qualitative data sources. In this preliminary work, we assess affordances in co-developing a curriculum that leverages sandbox approaches to data science. Ultimately (and what will be presented in our final submission), we aim to study learning outcomes when high school students' access, analyze and make sense of “big data” sets of their own. We collaborated with high school teachers in a West Texas/Paso Del Norte region where computer science educators are exceptionally scarce and where there is an urgent and persistent need to support underrepresented learner access to burgeoning areas of computing. Using mixed-methodological approaches (e.g., quantitative analysis of learner pre- and post-survey responses along with qualitative assessments of semi-structured interview data), we address the following research questions: (1) What affordances exist using co-design approaches to develop sandbox data science for pre-college learners? (2) Which computational concepts do students learn when carrying out CLDM activities, (3) Which computational practices do high school students enact when mining, processing, and analyzing big data sets in CLDM? (4) How do learner knowledge and perceptions about data science shift after participating in CLDM? We use contemporary perspectives in computing education, constructionism, and equity to discuss how open-ended sandbox approaches to computing-based data science support learner computational thinking, practice literacies, and field perceptions.",2377-634X,979-8-3503-3642-9,10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343283,National Science Foundation(grant numbers:2137708); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343283,Computer Science Education;Data Science Education;Constructionism;Curriculum Design;Computer Science Learning,Computer science;Smart textiles;Social networking (online);Statistical analysis;Affordances;Soft sensors;Scholarships,,,,19.0,IEEE,5 Jan 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

However, as new computer technologies emerge continuously and rapidly, it is required for this course to accommodate more and more knowledge. Therefore the teaching contents are growing enormously, which makes it very difficult to cover all of them in limited hours, and therefore sets an obstacle in understanding computing principles and building up a clear and general picture of computing, especially for non-major students. As computer science and technology are becoming more and more essential for various disciplines and majors, it is urgent for the education community to find out an effective and propagable way to solve this problem. In this regard, we employ virtual reality technology to the experiment teaching of this course, and have developed 18 virtual experiments to support the whole teaching process. For example, Turing machine is a basic model for computer science and technology. However, since it is not a real machine, it is not easy for the students to imagine the working process of Turing machine and understand the related concepts. Another example, the execution of an instruction is very important to understand the principles of computer organization. However, as the information flow is invisible, it is difficult and time-consuming for the teachers to explain how an instruction is executed inside a computer. Therefore, 3D modeling and animation techniques are used to demonstrate the invisible micro-structure of computers, and human-machine interaction and visualization techniques are used to present the internal process of information evolution, thus constructing a complete virtual experiment system of this course, including demonstration experiments, verification experiments and interaction experiments. Our virtual experiments have applied software copyrights and served more than 12,000 students from five universities of China since 2013. The evaluation demonstrates that the virtual experiments have produced excellent results in both teaching effectiveness and learning efficiency, relieved the conflicts between limited hours and vast knowledge, and helped students understand and build up the knowledge of computing.",,978-1-4799-8454-1,10.1109/FIE.2015.7344376,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344376,virtual experiments;Introduction to Computing;virtual reality,Computers;Random access memory;Education;Turing machines;Computational modeling;Computer science;Animation,,8.0,,10.0,IEEE,7 Dec 2015,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

It is not efficient enough to manage traffic with fixed waiting time. The organizers came up with the idea of developing an intelligent traffic light system with flexibility according to the number of cars in real-time by reducing waiting time. The paper was designed and developed by implementing the intelligent traffic light system using image processing technology to process the appropriate waiting time from each image frame. Lazarus and OpenGL were used to program based on Pascal language. The software has been developed for receiving traffic video at the intersection to process car image segmentation of each frame and to calculate the distance of the length of the car in each route in addition. It is also possible to calculate the appropriate time for green-light and red-light duration and corresponding to the length of the waiting vehicles in each route at the intersection. This investigated software can be used to reduce the waiting time at the traffic light intersection by 45.35%.

In addition to feedback based on run-time and output checking, we are particularly interested in immediate feedback: corrective guidance given as the program is being constructed. Immediate feedback is a natural extension of the block-based language philosophy. Block-based languages prevent by design certain types of mistakes in all cases. Immediate feedback guides against, without fully preventing, problem-specific mistakes (i.e., constructions that are erroneous in only some cases). A feedback specification contains a block pattern and a set of actions that can be taken whenever the corresponding pattern is present or absent in the student's block program for a given problem. The paper illustrates the language through several examples derived from misconceptions found in the block-based programs of students taking a university-level Computational Thinking class.

It displays an often-used method, which is applied in each field of computer science to investigate, describe and plan problems or structures. With the help of models, large and complex structures are divided into smaller parts, which leads to a better understanding of the problem and often provides input for the solution. With the help of different types of models, different perspectives of one problem can be observed and discussed. These processes are not only part of computer science respectively computational thinking. Problem solving skills are needed in any domain and should be trained as well as possible in primary and secondary education. This could be supported by the computer science concept of modeling including processes like reduction, decomposition, abstraction, generalization etc. and appropriate techniques like UML Unified Modeling Language or the Entity-relationship model. We suppose that a consequent use of modeling beginning in different subjects during primary and secondary education can train and improve problem-solving skills. Before being able to verify this hypothesis, it is necessary to find a way to integrate modeling in schools despite of not being part of the curriculum. This is one aim of our project “Informatics - A Child's Play”, which tries to implement different computer science concepts in different subjects of primary and secondary education. To reach this goal we firstly have to convince and train teachers. In this paper some topics of modeling are presented as they were adapted for workshops in primary and early secondary education considering the age and interests of the students as well as topics taken from their surroundings. Furthermore, we present first evaluation results concerning its acceptance and usefulness for teachers and students as well as their performance in understanding and applying modeling in different lessons.",,978-1-4799-8454-1,10.1109/FIE.2015.7344062,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344062,models;diagrams;general education;Entity-Relationship-model,Computational modeling;Education;Mathematical model;Unified modeling language;Informatics;Conferences,,5.0,,10.0,IEEE,7 Dec 2015,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Therefore, this paper presents a study investigating how the earnings of workers varied as a function of whether they used spreadsheets/databases and/or did programming at work. Examining survey data from 2003 revealed a positive correlation of earnings against these variables, even after controlling for the occupations of workers. Overall, occupation-adjusted earnings were 14% higher for workers who used spreadsheets/databases and who also did programming, versus those who did neither.

We observed two unexpected challenges when implementing EarSketch in high school Computer Science Principles courses. First, music that appeals to the students' generation may be difficult for teachers to appreciate (and vice versa). Second, while a majority of students engaged in music production and coding, we observed that some students fixated on artistic musical expression without engaging in substantial computational thinking.

The program, App Inventor, simplifies the process of coding, making it an ideal method of teaching beginners the basics of computer programming and computational thinking practice. The simplicity of the program is evident through the rapid learning process of the high schoolers, who were mostly beginners at coding. Additionally, during the process of teaching and helping the middle schooler's debugging session, the high school students were able to properly digest the principles and fundamentals of computer programming by revisiting and teaching what they learned. The students, both the high schoolers and middle schoolers, collaborated in exploring and experimenting with multiple variations of apps that could be made with the given teaching materials.

These courses frame the world around computation, and show learners that they can think about problems they see in everyday life in the context of computation. Our paper shows an analysis of repeat learners (learners who enroll in the same course multiple times) and their behaviors over the many runs of these courses. Around 20% of learners in any given run of a course are repeat learners. Of these, the majority are two-time repeat learners (learners who took the same course exactly twice). We show that learners tend to perform better when they retake a course, and especially when they retake the course sooner rather than later. We also look at a subgroup of learners we call repeat cross-referencers (learner who accessed at least two previous runs of the course during the run time of a later run of the course). We found that repeat cross-referencers complete the course at a suspiciously high rate, and we speculate it is because they are looking back at answers from a previous course run. Lastly, we look at how learners perform in an introductory class and an advanced class. We found that many learners who take both courses are more likely to complete both courses and have more active days in the courses than those learners who only do one of the two classes.",,978-1-7281-9728-9,10.1109/LWMOOCS50143.2020.9234342,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9234342,computation;programming;learners;cheating;MOOC,,,2.0,,7.0,IEEE,26 Oct 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

As creating a cyberspace workforce has become a matter of national security for every country, cybersecurity needs to be taught at all levels, to all students, in the educational system. The good news is that cybersecurity is also a topic that students from a wide variety of backgrounds find interesting, and as a result, it motivates them to study computing too. Over the past two decades, there has been an increased effort worldwide to incorporate computer science and computational thinking into the middle and high school curriculum. The CS10K initiative in the US has led to projects to introduce computer science at the K-12 educational level. One of these initiatives, the new Advanced Placement (AP) course in Computer Science Principles (CSP), was designed to introduce computer science in an engaging way, show students how computing is relevant in their lives, and to attract a diverse group of students to computing. The CSP Curriculum Framework allows for multiple implementations of the CSP course, permitting course designers to develop courses to engage and attract specific groups of students and that focus on specific themes in computing. This paper describes an approach to develop a new CSP course, CyberCSP, which integrates cybersecurity first principles throughout the course. The approach builds on an CSP course that was created from a previous collaboration between the Computer Science Department at Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York, and the Webster Central School District in Webster, New York. The paper discusses the background, details of the earlier CSP course, how relevant cybersecurity content was identified, and then integrated into the CSP course to create the CyberCSP variant of the Computer Science Principles course.",,978-1-5090-5920-1,10.1109/FIE.2017.8190711,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190711,,Computer science;Collaboration;Employment;Computer crime,,1.0,,20.0,IEEE,14 Dec 2017,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Teachers receive a stipend and tablets for their classrooms; they attend several in-person PD sessions through the year, where master teachers and PD facilitators introduce modeling of inquiry and equity-based practices, as well as teach the App Inventor tool and how to inculcate computational thinking in students. Project evaluation has included teacher interviews, classroom and PD observations, as well as student and teacher surveys. External evaluation of this project has been an integral part of the project from the beginning and, along with the project team’s observations and input, has significantly reshaped the project activities. It became clear after the first year that a central challenge of this project would be working with a mix of teachers across multiple domains – from teachers who had little experience even using computers to teachers who had computer science degrees; from teachers who came to teaching from professional backgrounds to those who had education degrees; and from beginning teachers to those who had been teaching the same courses for twenty years. Through evaluation data and really listening to teacher feedback, we not only tailored the PD content and structure, but also refined the data collection instruments and evaluation design to bridge the gap between different teacher experiences and levels of preparation. As a result, we have been able to bring computing into non-technical content areas such as Hospitality and non-programming classes such as Photography, as well as support computing educations in New Hampshire CTE programs.

Biomedical engineering enjoys higher rates of women's enrollment than other engineering disciplines, but nevertheless has gender disparities in persistence within the field. Additionally, trends towards greater incorporation of computation into biomedical engineering have the potential to recreate the gender inequities seen in more computationally intensive engineering disciplines. Recently, `engineering identity' has emerged as a powerful analytic lens to understand persistence in engineering, particularly for underrepresented groups such as women. However, there is limited work examining how experiences using computational methods influences engineering identity formation in undergraduate biomedical engineers. Further, it remains unclear to what extent gender differentially mediates the effects of computational practice on engineering identity formation. In order to explore the intersection of these issues, we study a thermodynamics course in the biomedical engineering department of a large Midwestern public research institution in the United States. The thermodynamics course includes in-class computational modeling group activities and has an enrollment of more than 120, primarily sophomore year, undergraduate students. We use a qualitative study approach that includes gathering data through classroom observation and detailed semi-structured interviews. We analyze classroom observation data to try to understand student experiences of learning and participation during in-class computational modeling exercises. Specifically, we look for evidence of gendered differences in task sorting and engagement with the exercise. Classroom data is complemented by semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews gains student's perspectives on how gender has influenced their learning experience and their identity as engineers.",2377-634X,978-1-7281-1746-1,10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028656,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028656,computation;engineering identity;gender,,,1.0,,15.0,IEEE,12 Mar 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

By comparing the results (learning progressions), some obvious and some not so obvious indications emerged. We believe that the more obvious indications give credence to the less obvious, and hence the measurement tool. This comparison between middle school students and college students demonstrated that middle school students' learning progressions are slower than college level students (obvious), but middle school students' learning skill scores reached/surpassed the entry level scores of students in the college class after designing only two or more games. Consequently, these results tell us that this measurement tool although not validated yet, could measure accumulated learning in certain contexts.

During this activity, students are required to work in small groups before in-class activities to answer open-ended questions related to the course learning materials via an online shared document. Based on teachers' duty, there are four stages for implementation of the proposed activity which are: (1) initiation: teacher needs to design open-ended questions and creates online shared editable documents for each group; (2) scaffolding: teacher assists learners in providing responses by checking their editing logs; (3) assessment: students' access to the online shared documents will be suspended and teacher will evaluate students responses; and (4) reflection: teacher will address common issues and propose more challenging questions before the related in-class activities.

However, many teachers do not realize what can be possible with robotics in the classroom, and this often causes them not to choose to learn more about this technology. In this work, we developed a web system called Repo-Educ in which a teacher can access information about robotics lessons created by other teachers, generating ideas about how to apply robotics in their classroom. Using this system, it is possible to transform robotics education by combining knowledge.

Blended learning approaches have the potential to reduce this barrier by facilitating the distribution of expertise across distances. In this poster we present our approach to understanding how to design blended learning models for the informal space that take advantage of the expertise of adult mentors and computer science experts. Our theoretical framing is based on Nacu et al. (2014) adult mentor roles, which suggest that adults play different roles (e.g., encourager, monitor, broker) to support students learning. We use Minecraft, a popular, 3D, online, multiplayer game, as our study context. The poster presents two studies that investigate ways of facilitating mentorship in a blended learning environment to teach computational thinking. Study 1 focuses on documenting the roles mentors play while facilitating a computer science-related Minecraft workshop with middle school students. Study 2 focuses on understanding how these roles are modified when online and in person mentors work together to facilitate a computational learning opportunity. Our initial findings suggest that defining a scalable model to support blended learning models in informal spaces requires a variety of mentor roles.

IoT is a topic to interest new learners in programming. Given the fact that there are already plenty of tools e.g. Micro:bit and Arduino designed to make IoT programming simple and full of fun, it is usually believed that adopting IoT topics is beneficial for younger students learning how to program. However, younger students’ learning performance in programming courses varies dramatically depending on the tools mentioned above. There are many metrics to predict the academic achievements of young students. Among them, the operation span is an objective one. Operation span mainly assesses one’s working memory capacity. According to the research results, one’s working memory capacity predicts individual high-level cognitive performance. Furthermore, students’ cognitive performance was highly related to their learning performance in programming courses. Nevertheless, the relationship between operation span and the learning performance of programming courses for junior high school students has not been researched yet. In Taiwan, computer programming has already been included as a mandatory subject in the junior high school curriculum for developing students' computational thinking and problem-solving skills. As such, understanding the relationship between OSPAN and programming performance is crucial for effective teaching and learning in this subject.

Providing timely, personalized feedback that makes students reflect about what and why they did correctly or incorrectly is critical in such courses. However, the limited number of instructors and the great volume of submissions instructors need to assess, especially in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), prove this task a challenge. One solution is to hire graders or create peer discussions among students, however, feedback may be too general, incomplete or even incorrect. Automatic techniques focus on: a) Functional testing, in which feedback usually does not sufficiently guide novices, b) Software verification to find code bugs, which may confuse novices since these tools usually skip true errors or produce false errors, and c) Comparing using reference solutions, in which a large amount of reference solutions or pre-existing correct submissions are usually required. This paper presents a semantic-aware technique to provide personalized feedback that aims to mimic an instructor looking for code snippets in student submissions.

Our goal in this study was to investigate how motivation, strategic self-regulation, and creative competency were associated with course achievement and long-term learning of computational thinking knowledge and skills in introductory computer science courses. Student grades and long-term retention were positively associated with self-regulated strategy use and knowledge building, and negatively associated with lack of regulation. Grades were associated with higher study effort and knowledge retention was associated with higher study time. For motivation, higher learning- and task-approach goal orientations, endogenous instrumentality, and positive affect and lower learning-, task-, and performance-avoid goal orientations, exogenous instrumentality and negative affect were associated with higher grades and knowledge retention and also with strategic self-regulation and engagement. Implicit intelligence beliefs were associated with strategic self-regulation, but not grades or knowledge retention. Creative competency was associated with knowledge retention, but not grades, and with higher strategic self-regulation.

The research questions focus on understanding which is the best medium to design algorithms by comparing flow chart and the Scratch programming language and by evaluating whether using textual language is worth the effort of the syntactic burden imposed by these languages. An analysis of quantitative and qualitative data revealed that both a visual programming and a flow-chart approach are suitable for algorithm design with no statistical difference in terms of number of errors and time taken to write the corresponding code in a textual language.

However, educators feel that they miss opportunities, skills, and tools to support pupils developing creativity. Hence, we proposed a digital learning environment, named Novelette, to support both educators and learners in performing visual storytelling by scaffolding them in inventing and authoring stories. The main novelty of our approach lies in embedding literary artifices widely explored in learning settings into a digital learning environment, such as the opportunity to continue someone else’s story and the suggestion mechanism to explore analogies or synonyms starting from a word of interest. Novelette has been ideated not only as a learning environment for educators, but with educators, as it results from a user-centered and participatory design methodology to involve them in the entire design and development process actively. This paper focuses on the assessment of Novelette usability according to both educators and pupils. As a conclusive step of the co-design approach, developers tested the resulting usability according to educators in a controlled environment. Moreover, it reports usability according to learners in real settings at school. Results demonstrate that Novelette is considered usable by both target groups, and it is perceived as a powerful approach in developing creativity both according to quantitative insight offered by the System Usability Scale, a.k.a., SUS, and qualitative interpretations enabled with direct observations and structured after scenario questionnaires.

In doing so, the paper offers a case study of the way in which Computational Archival Science, which blends archival and computational thinking, can be used to contribute to a novel approach towards solving the problem of fake videos.",,978-1-7281-0858-2,10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006170,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9006170,fake videos;trustworthiness of digital records;authenticity of videos;archival science,Metadata;YouTube;Big Data;Tools;Facebook;Visualization,,7.0,,60.0,IEEE,24 Feb 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Thus we ask, could a hackathon be used specifically within a CS1 class to motivate students and boost their performance (measured in grades)? In this article, we analyze data from 1253 students before and after an educational hackathon, observing changes in motivation towards the class and ultimately the students’ grades. We discovered that although there are variations in motivation and performance on those attending the Pyweekend, either as participants or attendants (general public), it is difficult to conclude that those variations are solely caused by the hackathon.

The students’ difficulties lead to failure, lack of motivation, and abandonment of courses. The problem is more significant in computer courses, where learning programming is essential. Programming is difficult and requires a lot of work from teachers and students. Programming is a process of transforming a mental plan into a computer program. The main goal of teaching programming is for students to develop their skills to create computer programs that solve real problems. There are several factors that can be at the origin of the problem, such as the abstract concepts that programming implies; the skills needed to solve problems; the mental skills needed to decompose problems; many of the students never had the opportunity to practice computational thinking or programming; students must know the syntax, semantics, and structure of a new unnatural language in a short period of time. In this work, we present a set of strategies, included in an application, with the objective of helping teachers and students.

Educational Pyramid Scheme – A Sustainable Way Of Bringing Innovations To School,H. Demarle-Meusel; M. Rottenhofer; B. Albaner; B.

One of the biggest challenges in education is the transfer of innovations and new didactic approaches into the school system. To ensure a high standard of teaching, it is essential that the teachers' expertise, pedagogical content knowledge as well as digital competences are continuously improved by further training. In-service training for teachers is offered in different settings (short-, middle- and long term), with advantages and disadvantages. Two aspects that correlate positively are the costs and the sustainable outcome of these trainings. With these aspects in mind the Educational Pyramid Scheme (EPS) is currently being developed and implemented as part of an Erasmus Plus project. It is an innovative concept that aims at spreading new learning contents and methods in a relatively short time within the school system, with low costs and high effect. It is inspired by the economical pyramid scheme, which is designed to create value through the exploitation of business opportunities. The transaction content of the Educational Pyramid Scheme refers to methods or strategies that are being exchanged, and to the resources and capabilities that are required to enable the exchange. According to a train-the-trainer principle, teachers and pupils will be qualified to be trainers, who then spread their knowledge and skills to people in their school and beyond. The EPS contains three different functions or roles: multipliers (teachers and scientists), mentors (teachers) and tutors (pupils). The motivation to participate is maintained with a benefit system adapted for each target group. The training of target groups follows high qualitative standards and therefore presents different phases: input, practical phase and reflection. This paper describes the development of the EPS and its first implementation in the framework of the Austrian mandatory curriculum ""Basic Digital Education"" including computational thinking and programming. It presents some qualitative results gained so far from interviews and observation, which are satisfactory and deliver good arguments for the further implementation of the EPS.",2377-634X,978-1-7281-8961-1,10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274172,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274172,teacher training;pyramid scheme;train the trainer;professional development;modeling,Training;Technological innovation;Stakeholders;Pupils;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Organizations,,5.0,,21.0,IEEE,4 Dec 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
My Robot can tell stories: Introducing robotics and physical computing to children using dynamic dioaramas,G. Manikutty,"Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, AMMACHI Labs, Amritapuri, India",2021 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),20 Dec 2021,2021,,,1,9,"From time immemorial, stories have caught the fascination of young and old. Rural children in India, in particular, have a natural way of telling stories that are rooted in their heritage of social norms, values, and belief systems that are compelling and emotionally engaging. The process of writing and narrating their own stories enhances their verbal proficiency and makes them reflect deeply upon the story theme, thereby enabling them to develop higher-order thinking. In this research study, the author used stories to introduce physical computing and robotics to children in rural India in a personally meaningful manner. Children created interactive cultural dioramas based on classical stories from Indian folklore with robotic puppets that they programmed using the Scratch programming language. They learned 21st-century skills of creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking by working in groups wherein they learned to divide tasks, manage time, work together, debate the pros and cons of different ideas, listen, think out of the box, and be active and engaged. The author observed that such an intervention improved the children's sense of agency and their interest in robotics and computational thinking. The author presents her results from pilot studies conducted in 2019 from two semi-urban schools in India on the children's perception of creating robots, programming, tinkering with electronics, career in robotics, and the workshop experience itself - all of which suggests that the children were deeply engaged and enthusiastic throughout the workshop making the entire learning experience a meaningful and joyful one for all. The results indicate that such culturally sensitive interventions can help children from collectivistic cultures embrace technology while preserving their traditional identities and cultural cohesion.",2377-634X,978-1-6654-3851-3,10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637460,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637460,STEM;Physical Computing;Robotics Education;21st Century Skills;Middle School Education;K-12 education,Conferences;Collaboration;Writing;Robot sensing systems;Cultural differences;Global communication;Task analysis,,5.0,,37.0,IEEE,20 Dec 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

However, cognitive skills are not sufficient for a successful life. Understanding and managing the emotions of oneself is another crucial factor in success. The current state of the art teaching methods educates the kids about programming and emotional intelligence independently. In our opinion, it is advantageous to teach kids emotional intelligence, along with the programming concepts. However, the literature lacks the studies that make students emotionally aware while teaching them programming. This research aims to prepare students to be cognitively healthy as well as emotionally intelligent with the hypothesis that a kid's emotional intelligence can be enhanced while teaching them cognitive skills. We proposed a computational model that teaches programming and emotional intelligence side by side to students. The model provides a curriculum and related tools. For evaluations, five hundred students of a public school were involved in different activities to find the effectiveness of the proposed model. These students were divided into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E), each having a mean age of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years, respectively. Students performed multiple adaptive scenarios of path-finding that were based on self-awareness, social-awareness, sharing, and empathy emotions. Students provide the programming instructions such as sequencing, conditional statements, and looping to a robot.

Gradual structuring: Evolving the spreadsheet paradigm for expressiveness and learnability,G. Miller; F. Hermans; R.

Their success has shown that they are simple enough for a huge number of end users to learn and use. This is in contrast to traditional programming languages and the high dropout rate from introductory programming and computer science. However in comparison to traditional programming languages and structured modelling, spreadsheets are not expressive, placing a limit on the levels of computational thinking that can be taught using the spreadsheet paradigm. This limitation is imposed by the lack of programming language features and abstractions in the paradigm. Furthermore, more advanced spreadsheet features (e.g. array formulae, lookup formulae, R1C1 syntax) can be difficult to learn and use. This paper discusses the idea of adding language features to spreadsheets, enabling the gradual structuring of free-form spreadsheets to more structured models. We propose that this concept is termed Gradual Structuring, and is analogous to the programming language concept of gradual typing. In this analogy, spreadsheets take the place of dynamic programming and structured modelling of static programming. In programming languages, gradual typing allows dynamic programming to be mixed with static programming. It is our contention that dynamic programming is more learnable while static programming is more expressive and abstract. Gradual typing could be used to mitigate the issues in the teaching of traditional programming. Likewise Gradual Structuring can mitigate the conceptual limits that can be taught using current spreadsheets. The key language feature required to enable Gradual Structuring is the ability to logically group cells together so that a single formula can be applied to the grouped cells. This concept, termed cell grouping diminishes and can even eliminate the need for the ubiquitous and error-prone use of copy-pasted in spreadsheets. Moreover, it makes the structure present in spreadsheet models explicit. Cell grouping requires a cascade of other new languages features. Namely a more expressive referencing style, which in turned requires enabling labels to be moved to the row and column headers, and the hierarchical structuring of these headers. Respectively these language features are termed enhanced referencing and semantic axes. The ongoing research focusses on the usability and learnability of these language features. Spreadsheet applications exist that contain aspects of the features mentioned. However these applications do not enable Gradual Structuring and have taken a mainly technical, not human behavioural, approach to evolving the spreadsheet.",,978-1-5090-0778-3,10.1109/ITHET.2016.7760759,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7760759,,Programming profession;Computer languages;Dynamic programming;Electronic mail;Education;Semantics,,2.0,,50.0,IEEE,1 Dec 2016,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Introducing computer programming in secondary schools: A case study of NAMTOSS,T. K. Mufeti; W.

For ICT to effectively contribute to the national development agenda however, there is a need to ensure that citizens are ICT literate. As a result, a number of countries have developed Subject Policy Guidelines aimed at introducing Computer Studies at Secondary School level. While most of these guidelines are carefully crafted, actual implementation in secondary schools has proved troublesome; having under-maintained or non-existent ICT infrastructures along with inadequately trained teachers as major obstacles. Subsequently, most African student's first exposure to computer programming occurs in the first year of university education, thus entering the Computer Science major without any prior hands-on experience.

Our 21st century K-12 students are no longer just computer users, but are now required to be computationally literate creators with proficient skills both in the concepts and practices of CS and CT. At the same time, technology continues to pervade our lives and expand at a relentless pace and all aspects of our lives are now embedded in technology surrounded by Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI in the form of Machine Learning (ML) is a key technology in a diversity of applications, where we use sensors to meaningfully perceive the world around us, analyze and organize the perceived data, and autonomously use that data to make predictions and decisions. In higher education, AI/ML courses proliferate, with many institutions now conferring degrees and certifications in these. To an extent, some high schools (grades 9–12) have started introducing these concepts in a technology class, or a robotics club, or as an after-school activity. As for middle (grades 6–8) and elementary school (grades K-5), there are very few examples of such instruction. In this paper, we present a complete framework for elementary and middle school teachers to help them prepare and incorporate AI/ML lessons in their classrooms using hands-on active learning strategies. We want to empower these teachers to impart improved learning to their students, which in turn will prepare their students to become effective thinkers, problem solvers, communicators, and gain necessary skills for high-skilled and high-demand jobs.

Design an Assessment for an Introductory Computer Science Course: A Systematic Literature Review,Q. Cheng; A. Tao; H. Chen; M. M. Samary,"Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA; Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA; Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA; Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA",2022 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),29 Nov 2022,2022,,,1,8,"This Research Full Paper presents a literature review on introductory CS assessments. As Computer Science (CS) becomes increasingly popular in the world of big data, more college students are taking introductory CS courses to follow the trend. However, students have different levels of exposure to CS when they start CS in college, varying from no experience to years of coding experience. This disparity in the amount of exposure can pose many problems. In the same intro-level class, some students may think they do not learn anything new, while others believe the professor goes through concepts so fast that they cannot follow the pace. CS professors may also feel confused about how to control the pace and content of introductory courses. Therefore, CS departments need an assessment to measure students’ CS knowledge and then assign them to the appropriate CS introductory courses. Though a vast number of research papers discuss CS introductory courses, few of them focus on developing and validating assessments that evaluate students’ background knowledge (i.e., concept inventory). This paper aims to conduct a systematic literature review to gain an overview of the most important introductory CS contents that need to be assessed, the methods to evaluate students’ understanding of introductory CS concepts, and some existing assessments/concept inventories. By reviewing relevant papers over the last 15 years, we selected 48 papers that are related to assessments and corresponding introductory courses. We collected assessment information and made tables of contents, question types, programming languages, and origins to analyze data. We found that iterations, conditionals, and variables are the most popular assessment contents. Multiple-Choice and Code Writing questions, which are more popular than Code Explaining questions, are the preferred ways of assessing students’ knowledge. Scratch is commonly used as a CS0 assessment language, while Python, Java, C, and Pseudo-codes are employed in CS1 assessments. FCS1, SCS1, and BDSI are existing assessments/concept inventories for CS1 or CS2, but there is not yet a validated assessment or concept inventory that encompasses introductory concepts of CS0 (computational thinking), CS1 (fundamentals), and CS2 (data structure). Designing a comprehensive CS0/CS1/CS2 assessment by using the information collected from our systematic literature review would help students choose the right course and benefit educators and researchers for general use.",2377-634X,978-1-6654-6244-0,10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962584,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962584,computer science education;introductory CS courses;assessment;concept inventory;systematic literature review,Computer science;Java;Systematics;Codes;Bibliographies;Buildings;Market research,,2.0,,68.0,IEEE,29 Nov 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Despite the wide range of resources used, students generally tend to perform poorly academically and perceive learning visual programming as a complex and demotivating task. In this article, the TutoApp system is proposed together with a new methodology based on “Learning by Teaching,” where students create tutorials on their mobile devices to explain programming concepts to their peers. The hypothesis of this article is that the use of this tool improves learning outcomes and the level of student satisfaction. An experiment with a pre–posttest design has been carried out with 57 university students in an introductory programming course, 30 belonging to a control group (did not use TutoApp) and 27 belonging to the experimental group (used TutoApp). The findings indicate that the creation of tutorials with TutoApp significantly improved students' academic performance over those who did not use it, specifically in learning the loops and conditional control structures.

In recent years, an educational movement has emerged that is related to the introduction of computational thinking, programming, and robotics in schools. Educational robotics is presented as one more resource that serves as a support in the different curricular subjects and facilitates the emergence of skills such as socialization, creative spirit and personal initiative, allowing participants to find answers to the problems that may arise in their reality. It is for this reason that a pilot test was carried out where we included the participants' parents in a session. To do this we used the Crumble controller, a platform that is programmed using block programming language. This platform also allows making electrical connections in an amazingly simple way. From the mechanical point of view, we use materials that can be easily machined, both by children and by inexperienced people. At the end of the experience, the assistants completed the assembly of their own robot. The article contains a study of the state of the art of using educational robotics.

However, almost no discussion has been conducted in Japan on how to measure the level of CT an elementary school child has acquired. Since the definition of CT is not very firm, it is not easy to measure the levels of CT. Therefore, several organizations have issued operational definitions of CT. Among the concepts of CT in those operational definitions, Algorithmic Thinking was chosen as a representative of CT, and the assessment tools for evaluating Algorithmic Thinking ability have been developed in this research. The assessment tool was conducted in the experimental Computer Science Unplugged classes and in the control classes in two elementary schools in Japan.

The curriculum serves middle school students to develop apps for social impact. The partnership focuses on bridging the gap between STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and community and gender gap within STEM. The project is based on Culturally Responsive Pedagogy (CRP), which includes the importance of recognizing students’ culture in all facets of learning. The project employs a researcher-practitioner partnership (RPP) model, which recognizes that transformational change can occur in educational ecosystems that connect research, policy, practice, and community work.The project curriculum was collaboratively developed by CS researchers, teacher-practitioners, and school administrators. Middle school students develop their own apps that support socially relevant activities in their communities. Using the RPP process, continuous feedback from researchers, teacher-practitioners, and students shaped the curriculum design. Key feedback was collected via one-on-one meetings with the teacher-practitioners, which bridged the visions and knowledge among different groups of the project partners.The curriculum includes the areas of computing and society, digital tools and collaboration, computing systems, and computational thinking. The curriculum helps students develop a critical consciousness of the role they can play in affecting their communities through computing, and empower them to move beyond simply learning to code [1].

The participants were in-service teachers in the technology domain. This research applied the AI2 Robot City, which is a computational thinking board game, to in-service teacher education. The learning content was image classification for AI application. Elementary and junior high school teachers operated the MIT App Inventor(MAI) and Personal Image Classifier(PIC) platform, and trained the model for practicing AI to implement supervised machine learning on the PIC platform. The learners then inserted the model they had trained into the block-based programming environment of MAI. They completed the smart phone app and used the app to recognize the board game cards so as to control the movement of the smart cars on the table map to meet the requirements of the task in the AI2 Robot City board game. In order to understand affective factors such as the self-efficacy and learning anxiety of the elementary and middle school teachers participating in the AI teacher training workshop, the MLSE and AILA scales were administered before and after the classes. A total of 28 samples were collected. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the MLSE of the elementary and junior high school teachers. However, the average AILA degree of the junior high school teachers was significantly higher than that of the elementary school teachers. It was found that AILA was significantly negatively correlated with MLSE. The elementary and junior high school teachers were confident that they could study AI-related courses. However, the AILA of the junior high school teachers was higher than that of the elementary school teachers. Therefore, more teacher training workshops on AI application can be conducted for junior high school teachers to generally improve their familiarity with AI application.

Motivating the New Generation: Using Flipped Classroom and ARCS Model to Enhance Block-Based Programming Education,W. -C. Choi; H. Lei; A. J.

Technology development has increased the importance of information technology-related competencies for the new generation. Programming skills are essential in various industries nowadays. Thus, programming education has become necessary to cultivate students' relevant abilities to meet the rapid pace of development. Programming learning encourages students to think logically and systematically, solve problems effectively, and develop computational thinking skills. However, learning programming is challenging for many students for different reasons, such as its inherent complexity, inadequate study methods, and pedagogical approaches unsuited to promote programming learning. Traditional teaching methods are often impersonalized and only suitable for some learning styles present in class. Moreover, the challenges encountered by the students as novice programmers are attributed to their low learning motivation. To learn to program, students must comprehend different syntactic conventions, complex instructions, and logical operators and actively engage in practical learning activities, often facing difficulties. This may reduce their learning motivation leading to failure and dropout. To accommodate different learning styles and increase students' motivation, this study employed the ARCS motivation model to design various innovative activities in a flipped classroom setting to increase students' motivation and improve teachers' teaching effectiveness. The study utilized a pretest-posttest method with two groups of grade five students to compare the effectiveness of teaching and learning between the flipped and traditional classroom students. The study's findings revealed that the flipped classroom experimental group showed significantly higher learning motivation than the students in the control group. Moreover, it was found that different flipped classroom activities, including the use of gamification, flipped videos, self-study, self-questioning, self-assessment, split programming tasks, group cooperation, and demonstration activities, had a positive influence on various sub-dimensions of the ARCS model, such as attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction.",2377-634X,979-8-3503-3642-9,10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342942,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342942,Flipped classroom;Computer science;Motivation;ARCS Model;Block-based programming education,Industries;Electronic learning;Education;Syntactics;Complexity theory;Online services;Task analysis,,1.0,,38.0,IEEE,5 Jan 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Utilization of Information Entropy in Training and Evaluation of Students’ Abstraction Performance and Algorithm Efficiency in Programming,Z. Wu; H. Liu; C.

This approach can provide students quantitative, comparative insights into the differences between optimal and student implemented solution, and allowing educators to offer targeted feedback, thereby optimizing the learning and abstraction processes in algorithm design through deliberate practice. Background: Abstraction is considered one of the most impor11 tant skills in problem solving. Many studies in programming have shown that higher abstraction capability can significantly simplify problems, reduce program complexity and improve efficiency. However, it is difficult to develop criteria to measure the level of abstraction, and there is still a lack of relevant systematic research. Research Questions: 1) How can students’ abstraction ability in programming be effectively measured? 2) How to develop programming education and training methods based on the measurement of abstraction ability? Methodology: Forty-six grade 10 students participated in the experiment, divided into two groups for programming train23 ing using information-entropy-based assessment and traditional learning methods. Their level of computational thinking, algo25 rithmic efficiency improvements, and test scores were used to measure performance and to analyze the effectiveness of the training methods.

Challenges in Digital STEM Education Delivery: A Case Study from the Teachers' Perspective,I. Possaghi; S. Papavlasopoulou,"Department of Computer Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway; Department of Computer Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway",2024 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON),8 Jul 2024,2024,,,1,10,"In the last decade, educational reforms introduced technologies and digital tools to a higher degree, serving as powerful catalysts in educational innovation for creating, managing, and delivering content in STEM education with a focus on computational and engineering subjects. However, in the small reality of the classroom, some discrepancies arise between policy objectives and everyday practice. The research community emphasises the importance of providing technology infusions based on educators' pedagogical beliefs as well as needs rooted in the authentic scholarly environment. Considering this perspective when orchestrating in-classroom technology can support educators in their daily experiences and enhance their digital competencies. To contribute to this aim, we propose a case study carried out via interviews with fellow primary and secondary teachers, tackling challenges in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), including Computer Science (CS) and Computational thinking (CT) education delivery. Along with the teachers' perspectives, our study aims to obtain a detailed account of the classroom's internal dynamics as perceived by the teachers. The most prominent findings concern the disparity among educators' proficiency in technology endorsement, impacting the consistency in content delivery, the complexity of the assessment of students' learning process if it is digital-based, and the inclusivity and trustworthiness of online content. Finally, we suggest guidance for a further mindful in-school uptake of technology to support teachers in orchestrating content delivery with educational technologies and enhance their confidence in this aspect.",2165-9567,979-8-3503-9402-3,10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578908,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10578908,Digital Literacy;STEM;Digital Education;Learning;Educational Technology;Teachers,Computer science;Technological innovation;Catalysts;Educational technology;Complexity theory;Stakeholders;Interviews,,,,45.0,IEEE,8 Jul 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Human-Centered Digital Sustainability: Handling Enumerated Lists in Digital Texts,M. Csernoch; T. Nagy; K. Nagy; J. Csernoch; C.

This entropy reveals that the more underdeveloped documents are, the more demanding their content-related modification becomes. It was also found that the time and data required to complete a modification task in an erroneous document is several times more than in its correct counterpart. This finding leads to the end-user paradox: the less trained end-users are, the more errors they make, and the modification of their documents requires more resources. To resolve these discrepancies, the present study defines the sustainability rate of natural language digital texts which calculates the losses – the waste of human resources, time, workspace, computers, energy, frustration, working in bees, losing data – generated by negligent text management. Furthermore, we present examples of how manual and enumerated lists behave to modifications in a 213-page long document and conclude from our investigations that while the waste of human and machine resources occurs repeatedly in erroneous documents, the sustainability rate remains low. To prove the necessity of correction, we cleared the sample document, which took approximately 67 hours of two experts of our research group ( $2\times67$  hours). With this method, we found that the correction of errors can be extremely demanding, but uses resources only once, and further modifications in the now correct document need only the content-required amount of time, activities, entropy, and resources, in accordance with the expectations of the person intended to update the document. To correct documents, we present the Error Recognition Model, which is proved effective and efficient in digital education. All our findings indicate that both education and industry should adapt the presented approach (1) to develop students’ and end-users’ computational thinking skills, (2) to manage and take advantage of errors, (3) to recognize connections between the structure of the text and the complex word processing tools, (4) to pay attention to digital sustainability – beyond hardware and software development and recycling – with a focus on the human factor. Recently, the Error Recognition Model is a reactive problem-solving approach, whose effectiveness is justified. However, the near future is to run parallel the reactive and proactive uses of this approach, while if we look far into the future, the proactive use to digital born natural language texts should dominate.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3369587,"Kdp-2021 Program of the Ministry for Innovation and Technology from the Source of the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund; MTA(grant numbers:89/2/2022/KP); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10444509,Documentation;education;human–computer interaction;information entropy;sustainability,Education;Sustainable development;Text processing;Entropy;Software engineering;User centered design;Human factors;Natural language processing;Text recognition;Complex networks;Software development management;Error analysis;Problem-solving,,,,148.0,CCBYNCND,23 Feb 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

National personalities and elongated election seasons inundated with negative campaigning may have ""turned-off"" potential voters, but as the popular aphorism goes, ""all politics are local,"" and thus local conditions should be interrogated to help understand voting and other forms of political participation. To this end, this study seeks to probe more deeply into this phenomenon by examining local political participation in the American states. For reasons we outline below, we specifically focus on local political participation in the state of Tennessee (TN) Utilizing data from the 2016 Congressional Cooperative Election Study (CCE), we ask what local-level factors most likely influence political participation among Blacks in TN?

Pre-studies analyzing students' perspectives regarding the inclusion of digital competences in the teacher education program of a large Central-European university revealed that less than half of the students who were at an advanced stage in their studies felt sufficiently prepared to impart digital competences in their daily teaching. Given the importance of being digitally competent in the modern, digital era, the question arises, how digital competences can be sustainably included in the curriculum of a teacher education program. This paper analyzes interviews with five faculty members successfully teaching digital skills in concert with subject didactics of Geography in order to identify best practices for the integration of digital competences. The first author asked our Interview Partners to provide insight into the content they mediated, the integration of digital competences and tools in their courses, how their teaching could be further improved, and what challenges they encounter. Eventually, we looked for best practices and collected instructors' thoughts on improvements on a curricular level and examples of transferring the good practices to other subjects, such that future students could benefit from a better integration of digital competences. For this paper, we analyzed the data with a mixture of narrative analysis and thematic analysis. Improving the mediating of digital skills and competences in a wider range of subjects at the university level should eventually help students, and ultimately their students, to implement digital know-how such as modern teaching tools into their courses, making teaching more effective and computational thinking as well as related fields of computing more accessible to academic as well as secondary and younger students. The research so far has shown promising results considering examples of tools that can be used on a broad spectrum of subjects and lead to a factor of learned new digital competences if used properly. On the other hand, lecturers also warned about relying too much on technology in specific tasks such as orientation on a map or analyzing statistical data. We conclude that combining existing approaches with new, more modern didactics can be the key to transferring the competencies required for our students' future.",2377-634X,979-8-3503-3642-9,10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343210,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343210,digital skills;teacher education;pre-service teachers;basic digital education;interviews,Geography;Digital transformation;Education;Open Educational Resources;Behavioral sciences;Interviews;Task analysis,,,,28.0,IEEE,5 Jan 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The activity requires teamwork and creativity. As lectures run as workshops, allowing collaboration and project creation, with the help of teachers and older students as tutors. To complete the program, an event made available by the university was used as an environment, for visitors, scholars as well for high school juniors interested in software, to attend and learn about. As a preliminary result of the new implementation methodology, after 4 years, there was an increase in the approval and average grade of learners.",2377-634X,978-1-7281-8961-1,10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274109,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274109,education;algorithms;computing;teaching methodology,Games;Programming;Programming profession;Conferences;Training;Tools;Problem-solving,,,,25.0,IEEE,4 Dec 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

To properly address the lack of structured materials in secondary schools, an Educational Design Research (EDR) project was developed to introduce young students to STEM, and particularly to electronics field. For this purpose, the developed approach combines instructionism and constructionism methods, through three educational projects and “Drops of knowledge” modules. The developed material was applied to 9th and 12th grades of a secondary school, with the achieved results showing that this immersive approach effectively provides students with the necessary competencies to tackle the initial technological challenges of electronics.

Engineering Student Perspectives of a New Required Programming Course,J. Parham-Mocello; J. Garcia; M. Sadler,"School of EECS, Oregon State University, Corvallis, USA; School of EECS, Oregon State University, Corvallis, USA; School of EECS, Oregon State University, Corvallis, USA",2023 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),5 Jan 2024,2023,,,1,9,"In this research to practice report, we present student perceptions of a new first-year engineering programming class that was designed by informed research practices. While the College of Engineering at the participating university saw a lot of major switching in the first year, there were not many students switching into computer science (CS). This could have been because other engineering major classes did not transfer well to CS or that students would be a year behind in the programming classes. In either case, the participating university felt that computational thinking and programming were an important part of first-year engineering exploration and believed that all 21st century engineering majors should learn to program in a general purpose language, such as Python or C++. Past research found that prior programming experience, knowledge organization, self-efficacy, and class size were factors impacting student performance in early programming courses, and learning about programming enhanced students' problem-solving skills and improved perceptions about CS. Many other research studies showed that the context in which programming material was presented to non-majors was important for their learning and interest, and themed, mixed-context courses with real-world engineering problems worked well. Therefore, in the spring 2022, we created 12, 100-person sections of a course titled “Engineering Computational and Algorithmic Thinking” for a new first-year engineering experience. Each section was taught by a different instructor representing a variety of disciplines and topics in the College of Engineering. This paper describes the research to practice and engineering student perceptions of the new, required programming class. We hypothesized that engineering students would say that the course should be required for all engineering majors, but we wanted to know why. We believed that student prior programming experience, engineering major, and other demographics would play a role in their responses. We thematically analyzed student justifications to identify emerging themes, and we used a mixed-method approach to correlate themes to different student demographics, engineering major interest, and prior programming experience. The majority of engineering students agreed that the first-year engineering course should be required, and prior programming experience and major played the largest role.",2377-634X,979-8-3503-3642-9,10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343028,Lemelson Foundation(grant numbers:20-01770); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343028,computer science;first-year engineering;programming,Knowledge engineering;Switches;Organizations;Manufacturing;Problem-solving;Engineering students;Springs,,,,34.0,IEEE,5 Jan 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Computational thinking involves solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behavior by drawing on the concepts fundamental to computer science. Thinking like a computer scientist means more than being able to program a computer. It requires the ability to abstract and thus to think at multiple levels of abstraction.

In this social context, education, like any productive or service sector, is affected by technology. Faced with this reality, educational systems must prepare our young people to live in the digital world, for which they must be proficient in a new language without which they will become digital illiterates. Therefore, in school we should not only train in linguistic and numerical literacy, but also in digital literacy. So far, the effort has been oriented mainly to convert our young people into users of computer tools. This has gone from being necessary to being insufficient, because the use of software applications means to manage a digital language that is obsolete in a time that is not proportional, in effort, to the time that has been invested in acquiring these skills. Therefore, the challenge is to prepare our young people to face the world in which they live, giving them the necessary cognitive tools to succeed in the digital world. That is, instead of teaching students only the syntax of a changing language, they should be instructed in the rules that allow them to know how the digital language is constructed.

We now understand that these different experiences arise from different motivations, different approaches to the task of programming, and different expectations about the outcomes. This talk reports results from a 10 year programme of research, engaging with collaborators who have been sought out precisely because their motivations, work methods and intentions are as different as possible from typical engineering programmers. These investigations have involved the development of a wide range of novel programmable systems and notations designed for use by choreographers, composers, musicians, and visual artists. The findings extend previous analyses of computational experience such as the attention investment model of abstraction use, and the cognitive dimensions of notations, drawing attention to ways of programming that are not only utilitarian, but playful and engaging. Research of this kind also helps us to understand that there are not necessarily different kinds of people in the world - those who are creative or not - but rather different ways of engaging with technology, available to all designers painting from the palette of human-centric computing systems.",1943-6106,978-1-4673-0853-3,10.1109/VLHCC.2012.6344467,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6344467,,,,1.0,,,IEEE,10 Nov 2012,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
