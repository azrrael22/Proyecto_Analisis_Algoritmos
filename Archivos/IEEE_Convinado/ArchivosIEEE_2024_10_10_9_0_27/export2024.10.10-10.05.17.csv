The discipline of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has already been implemented, a discipline that involves both the formation of skills to use new technologies and the formation of computational thinking necessary for the efficient and intelligent use of these technologies. In order to teach and learn Physics from a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) educational perspective, we initiated optional school courses of IoT, Robotics and AI (approached through Machine Learning). These courses stimulate, at the level of students, computational thinking, creativity and innovation and lead, from an interdisciplinary perspective, to the development of emerging specializations such as Mathematics-Physics-Automation, Mathematics-Physics-Electronics, Mathematics-Physics-Informatics-Robotics etc. In this paper we presented a method of approaching, in the school educational space, the study of wireless communication technologies between smart devices, through an Educational Robotics project. The project consisted of creating a wireless controlled mobile robotic platform (robot car) via a Bluetooth module connected to an Arduino Uno board.","2379-0482","978-1-6654-3939-8","10.1109/CSCS52396.2021.00073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9481012","wireless communication;Arduino Uno;Bluetooth module HC-05;joystick;motor driver L298N","Bluetooth;Robot kinematics;Microwave communication;Microwave amplifiers;Information and communication technology;Internet of Things;Smart devices","","5","","9","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The program is aimed at teaching under-represented immigrant engineer students to learn how to program in the Java programming language. The programming concepts and the fostered pedagogical environment were implemented in three-hour evening sessions over 15 weeks in which the students were encouraged to develop programming communities while working on computational thinking concept strands. The research findings that we report are threefold. First, we report on how we fostered building programming concepts into the curriculum into a set of activities specifically designed for an immigrant engineer retraining program with students ranging in backgrounds. We found that at that the program curriculum must be flexible enough for student learning regardless of the fact that a student may miss sessions. Second, we report on how an effective pedagogical environment, which fosters student-centered learning, was promoted so that the students could construct their own meanings of the programming concepts. Third, we report on implementation strategies unique to a retraining program, such as specific environmental constraints as well as how sessions were partitioned into components that fostered computational thinking while learning Java. Our findings provide unique insights into intervention constraints for an urban retraining program which can be used to guide and inform further retraining computer learning program research.","","978-1-5090-5920-1","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190558","","Java;Education;Programming profession;Urban areas","","1","","44","IEEE","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Enculturation can be understood as the process by which students are assimilated into the engineering culture. This culture involves the base knowledge, practices, and values shared by the community of practicing engineers. Both the culture and its assimilation are somewhat obscure and often attributed to role-modeling and hidden curriculum. Nevertheless, undergraduate students are expected to undergo this assimilation process, and by the end of a five-year program, they behave, talk, and do what engineers do. An approach to this process is the well-established model of engineering identity. This model of identity, however, limits its scope to the intrinsic process occurring in the student without paying much attention to the support systems expected to welcome and nurture students into the profession. Enculturation is a relatively new model that proposes both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting this assimilation of students. During the Spring of 2022, a team of researchers at a U.S. Southwest institution applied a survey to operationalize the extrinsic factors of a recently outlined engineering model of enculturation to understand the impact of COVID on engineering students. Eight Likert-based questions were asked to 534 engineering undergraduate students at different school year classifications (e.g., sophomore, junior, or senior). The model of enculturation tested eight extrinsic factors involving (1) engineering design, (2) teamwork, (3) engineering profession, (4) ethics, (5) engineering communications, (6) mathematical/physical modeling, (7) problem-solving, and (8) algorithmic/computational thinking. Additional Likert-based questions asked students about the perceived impact of COVID on their educational experience. The research questions guiding their investigation were: (a) How are the dimensions of enculturation to engineering changing across engineering undergraduate classifications?, and (b) How is enculturation associated with the COVID impact on students? Preliminary results show that six of the factors (namely 1–5 and 7) increase by students' school classification. This means that students in the lower years of their undergraduate program perceive their enculturation, as portrayed by factors 1–5 & 7, less than students at more advanced stages of their program. In terms of the perceived impact of COVID, only two factors showed negative correlations with this perceived impact The factors were ethics and algorithmic/computational thinking. In other words, the worse the student's perception of COVID's impact on their educational experience, the less they endorsed their enculturation in the impact of society of their technical solutions and their use of programming languages. While these results show encouraging applicability of the enculturation model, it can only be considered a first approach to a more fully developed model. The researchers expect to engage the FIE community in a discussion leading to a more refined enculturation model.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343256","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343256","Enculturation to engineering;COVID impact;curriculum","COVID-19;Surveys;Knowledge engineering;Ethics;Organizations;Mathematical models;Teamwork","","","","13","USGov","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, introducing programming at such an early stage presents unique challenges, given the need for students to grasp mathematical concepts, abstract thinking, and the intricacies of programming syntax. Educational Data Mining (EDM) offers a potential contribution by predicting learning performance, facilitating the optimization of the learning processes, and providing real-time guidance. A notable gap in the current literature about EDM in programming education is its predominant emphasis on the university level. Our research objectives were to identify features influencing primary school students' programming capabilities. A more comprehensive dataset was introduced, incorporating psychometric data and highlighting features such as learning motivation and attitude, computational thinking data, and other potentially influential variables, which set our study apart from previous studies. We found that the strongest predictor was academic performance in Information Technology, followed by psychometric data on students' learning attitudes and motivation. Computational thinking also emerged as a significant feature in predicting programming performance. It's worth highlighting that involvement in extra-curricular activities, like Olympic Mathematics training, showed a significant association, underscoring the importance of mathematical logic and reasoning in programming. This is further bolstered by the evident correlation with academic performance in Mathematics, confirming its pivotal role in shaping programming abilities. Interestingly, the correlation of academic performance in Chinese is also significant, indicating that the language medium of instruction can notably influence success.","2165-9567","979-8-3503-9402-3","10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578608","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10578608","Computer science;Programming Education;Educational Data Mining;Educational features correlation;Performance prediction;Features selection","Training;Performance evaluation;Computers;Correlation;Syntactics;Mathematics;Cognition","","","","31","IEEE","8 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One such Either-Or binary that is relevant to our project so far is computing vs. computational thinking.2 A keynote address delivered recently at a computing education conference by the computer scientist and educator Judy Robertson is quite illuminating in this respect.3 Robertson argued against a blind emphasis on computational “thinking” as the centerpiece of computational literacy. Focusing only on creating SCRATCH programs may lead especially young learners away from understanding how the computer actually works as a “machine.” Children's drawings of what is inside a computer show that learning to use computational abstractions that we typically introduce in the K-12 levels—such as variables and loops—does not necessarily help us understand how these abstractions are processed and represented inside the computer. What gets lost in our push to teach children how to code is the physicality of computing as a machine, which involves a deeper understanding of the relationship between the hardware and software—and many other forms of computational abstractions that are not even presented to children as part of their experience of coding or computing.","","9780262363075","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9388156.pdf&bkn=9382289&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","29 Mar 2021","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

In response, there has been growing attention in research and practice emphasizing pre-college groups. This is partly because of the growing recognition-reflected in initiatives like CS4ALL, Code.org, Bootstrap: Data Science, Exploring Computer Science-that learning experiences before college are consequential in sustaining a robust pipeline of computer scientists and engineers. Despite these inroads, there is justifiable concern that existing efforts might not fully support learner development in the necessary conceptual, epistemological, and heuristic styles needed to productively parse and understand “big data.” This is because computing-based curricula that include data science often involve data curated by others (rather than learners directly), which results in simulated versions of practice instead of engagement that is realistically discursive and messy. This is further complicated by the persistent shortage of K-12 computer science teachers in general and even fewer who can design and implement curricula that support authentic engagement with data science. To address these issues, we leverage culturally relevant and constructionist perspectives in a sandbox (i.e., open-ended) science where tools like Scratch and electronic textiles (E-textiles) have had success expanding possibilities in computing to also include activities where learners can engage broadly along varied pursuits-and encounter challenges that spur computational thinking and problem-solving. The literature suggests that learning activities framed in this way encourage knowledge construction, practice literacies, and seriously impact learner attitudes, interest, and perceptions of growth in the field. This latter set of self-concept measures represents a few of many related key predictors of long-term field participation and persistence. In this work-in-progress scholarship of discovery research, we co-develop, with youth and educators, “Coding Like a Data Miner” (CLDM)-a sandbox approach to computing-based data science wherein learners access a social media platform, Twitter, to mine, analyze, and understand quantitative and qualitative data sources. In this preliminary work, we assess affordances in co-developing a curriculum that leverages sandbox approaches to data science. Ultimately (and what will be presented in our final submission), we aim to study learning outcomes when high school students' access, analyze and make sense of “big data” sets of their own. We collaborated with high school teachers in a West Texas/Paso Del Norte region where computer science educators are exceptionally scarce and where there is an urgent and persistent need to support underrepresented learner access to burgeoning areas of computing. Using mixed-methodological approaches (e.g., quantitative analysis of learner pre- and post-survey responses along with qualitative assessments of semi-structured interview data), we address the following research questions: (1) What affordances exist using co-design approaches to develop sandbox data science for pre-college learners? (2) Which computational concepts do students learn when carrying out CLDM activities, (3) Which computational practices do high school students enact when mining, processing, and analyzing big data sets in CLDM? (4) How do learner knowledge and perceptions about data science shift after participating in CLDM? We use contemporary perspectives in computing education, constructionism, and equity to discuss how open-ended sandbox approaches to computing-based data science support learner computational thinking, practice literacies, and field perceptions.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343283","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:2137708); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343283","Computer Science Education;Data Science Education;Constructionism;Curriculum Design;Computer Science Learning","Computer science;Smart textiles;Social networking (online);Statistical analysis;Affordances;Soft sensors;Scholarships","","","","19","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are reports that indicate that students learning to program in this environment show certain habits that are contrary to the basic programming recommendations. In our work as instructors with high school students, we have detected these and other bad practices, such as the repetition of code and object naming, on a regular basis. This paper focuses on verifying whether these issues can generally be found in the Scratch community, by analyzing a large number of projects available on the Scratch community website. To test this hypothesis, we downloaded 100 projects and analyzed them with two plug-ins we developed to automatically detect these bad practices.

However, as new computer technologies emerge continuously and rapidly, it is required for this course to accommodate more and more knowledge. Therefore the teaching contents are growing enormously, which makes it very difficult to cover all of them in limited hours, and therefore sets an obstacle in understanding computing principles and building up a clear and general picture of computing, especially for non-major students. As computer science and technology are becoming more and more essential for various disciplines and majors, it is urgent for the education community to find out an effective and propagable way to solve this problem. In this regard, we employ virtual reality technology to the experiment teaching of this course, and have developed 18 virtual experiments to support the whole teaching process. For example, Turing machine is a basic model for computer science and technology. However, since it is not a real machine, it is not easy for the students to imagine the working process of Turing machine and understand the related concepts. Another example, the execution of an instruction is very important to understand the principles of computer organization. However, as the information flow is invisible, it is difficult and time-consuming for the teachers to explain how an instruction is executed inside a computer. Therefore, 3D modeling and animation techniques are used to demonstrate the invisible micro-structure of computers, and human-machine interaction and visualization techniques are used to present the internal process of information evolution, thus constructing a complete virtual experiment system of this course, including demonstration experiments, verification experiments and interaction experiments. Our virtual experiments have applied software copyrights and served more than 12,000 students from five universities of China since 2013. The evaluation demonstrates that the virtual experiments have produced excellent results in both teaching effectiveness and learning efficiency, relieved the conflicts between limited hours and vast knowledge, and helped students understand and build up the knowledge of computing.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344376","virtual experiments;Introduction to Computing;virtual reality","Computers;Random access memory;Education;Turing machines;Computational modeling;Computer science;Animation","","8","","10","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The traffic light management system in the current situation has used a fixed waiting time, which inability to be flexible according to the traffic at different times such as in rush hour and other. It is not efficient enough to manage traffic with fixed waiting time. The organizers came up with the idea of developing an intelligent traffic light system with flexibility according to the number of cars in real-time by reducing waiting time. The paper was designed and developed by implementing the intelligent traffic light system using image processing technology to process the appropriate waiting time from each image frame. Lazarus and OpenGL were used to program based on Pascal language. The software has been developed for receiving traffic video at the intersection to process car image segmentation of each frame and to calculate the distance of the length of the car in each route in addition. It is also possible to calculate the appropriate time for green-light and red-light duration and corresponding to the length of the waiting vehicles in each route at the intersection. This investigated software can be used to reduce the waiting time at the traffic light intersection by 45.35%. In addition, the intelligent traffic light system is also a social development towards a smart city.

In addition to feedback based on run-time and output checking, we are particularly interested in immediate feedback: corrective guidance given as the program is being constructed. Immediate feedback is a natural extension of the block-based language philosophy. Block-based languages prevent by design certain types of mistakes in all cases. Immediate feedback guides against, without fully preventing, problem-specific mistakes (i.e., constructions that are erroneous in only some cases). A feedback specification contains a block pattern and a set of actions that can be taken whenever the corresponding pattern is present or absent in the student's block program for a given problem. The paper illustrates the language through several examples derived from misconceptions found in the block-based programs of students taking a university-level Computational Thinking class. The feasibility of the proposed approach is shown by the translation of a specification using an evolving programmatic interface in BlockPy, a dual block/text programming environment for a subset of Python.","","978-1-5386-2480-7","10.1109/BLOCKS.2017.8120407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8120407","Immediate feedback;formative feedback;block-based languages;novice programming environments","Programming;Semantics;Programming environments;Specification languages;Meteorology;Syntactics;Temperature","","6","","12","IEEE","30 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It displays an often-used method, which is applied in each field of computer science to investigate, describe and plan problems or structures. With the help of models, large and complex structures are divided into smaller parts, which leads to a better understanding of the problem and often provides input for the solution. With the help of different types of models, different perspectives of one problem can be observed and discussed. These processes are not only part of computer science respectively computational thinking. Problem solving skills are needed in any domain and should be trained as well as possible in primary and secondary education. This could be supported by the computer science concept of modeling including processes like reduction, decomposition, abstraction, generalization etc. and appropriate techniques like UML Unified Modeling Language or the Entity-relationship model. We suppose that a consequent use of modeling beginning in different subjects during primary and secondary education can train and improve problem-solving skills. Before being able to verify this hypothesis, it is necessary to find a way to integrate modeling in schools despite of not being part of the curriculum. This is one aim of our project “Informatics - A Child's Play”, which tries to implement different computer science concepts in different subjects of primary and secondary education. To reach this goal we firstly have to convince and train teachers. In this paper some topics of modeling are presented as they were adapted for workshops in primary and early secondary education considering the age and interests of the students as well as topics taken from their surroundings. Furthermore, we present first evaluation results concerning its acceptance and usefulness for teachers and students as well as their performance in understanding and applying modeling in different lessons.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344062","models;diagrams;general education;Entity-Relationship-model","Computational modeling;Education;Mathematical model;Unified modeling language;Informatics;Conferences","","5","","10","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, this paper presents a study investigating how the earnings of workers varied as a function of whether they used spreadsheets/databases and/or did programming at work. Examining survey data from 2003 revealed a positive correlation of earnings against these variables, even after controlling for the occupations of workers. Overall, occupation-adjusted earnings were 14% higher for workers who used spreadsheets/databases and who also did programming, versus those who did neither.

The main goal of this study is to examine which programming concepts students use when they want to develop a game, and what is the interrelation among these concepts. To achieve our goal, a field study was designed and data were collected from coding activities. In detail, during a two-week period, one-day workshops were organized almost every day on which 44 children participating in, with ages between 8-17. The workshops follow a constructionist approach and comprise of two parts. First the children interact with robots, and then develop a game using Scratch. The findings provide a deeper understanding on how children code by showing the use of specific programming concepts to develop their projects and their correlations.

The curriculum fully employs PBL strategies in global teams, where teams for PBL are organized with students with heterogeneous cultural backgrounds in the virtual learning environment. The basic concept of such curriculum is based on COIL (Collaborative Online International Learning), originally developed by State University of New York. COIL makes full usage of IT to generate virtual learning environment for students worldwide. In order to go beyond the COIL concept incorporating the future skills defined by IFTF, the allied universities employed PBL in global AGILE teams to deepen insights from various cultural viewpoints in terms of consensus building through team discussions. Due to the spatial and temporal differences, enrolled students conducted their team learning activities in the virtual learning environment asynchronously, making use of IT technologies and cloud services in order to be on ""the same page"" in the progress of the project throughout the course.

We observed two unexpected challenges when implementing EarSketch in high school Computer Science Principles courses. First, music that appeals to the students' generation may be difficult for teachers to appreciate (and vice versa). Second, while a majority of students engaged in music production and coding, we observed that some students fixated on artistic musical expression without engaging in substantial computational thinking. These findings may apply more broadly in computational courses situated in expressive domains and to STEAM courses in general. We conclude with suggested changes to professional development, which may be applied more generally to creative computation and STEAM-based courses.","","978-1-5090-3419-2","10.1109/RESPECT.2016.7836171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7836171","music composition;computer science principles;student engagement;culture;STEAM","Music;Encoding;Education;Computer science;Interviews;Cultural differences;Computational modeling","","2","","9","IEEE","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The program, App Inventor, simplifies the process of coding, making it an ideal method of teaching beginners the basics of computer programming and computational thinking practice. The simplicity of the program is evident through the rapid learning process of the high schoolers, who were mostly beginners at coding. Additionally, during the process of teaching and helping the middle schooler's debugging session, the high school students were able to properly digest the principles and fundamentals of computer programming by revisiting and teaching what they learned. The students, both the high schoolers and middle schoolers, collaborated in exploring and experimenting with multiple variations of apps that could be made with the given teaching materials.

Two MOOC courses provide an introduction to computation and are offered by MIT on EdX: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python has run 16 times and 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science has run 11 times. These courses frame the world around computation, and show learners that they can think about problems they see in everyday life in the context of computation. Our paper shows an analysis of repeat learners (learners who enroll in the same course multiple times) and their behaviors over the many runs of these courses. Around 20% of learners in any given run of a course are repeat learners. Of these, the majority are two-time repeat learners (learners who took the same course exactly twice). We show that learners tend to perform better when they retake a course, and especially when they retake the course sooner rather than later. We also look at a subgroup of learners we call repeat cross-referencers (learner who accessed at least two previous runs of the course during the run time of a later run of the course). We found that repeat cross-referencers complete the course at a suspiciously high rate, and we speculate it is because they are looking back at answers from a previous course run. Lastly, we look at how learners perform in an introductory class and an advanced class. We found that many learners who take both courses are more likely to complete both courses and have more active days in the courses than those learners who only do one of the two classes.","","978-1-7281-9728-9","10.1109/LWMOOCS50143.2020.9234342","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9234342","computation;programming;learners;cheating;MOOC","","","2","","7","IEEE","26 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ongoing trends towards urbanization, global travel, climate change and a generally older and immuno-compromised population continue to make epidemic planning and control challenging. Recent quantitative changes in high performance pervasive computing have created new opportunities for collecting, integrating, analyzing and accessing information related to large urban social systems, disease surveillance and global logistics and supply chains. The advances in network and information science that build on this new capability provide entirely new ways for reasoning and controlling epidemics.

The CS10K initiative in the US has led to projects to introduce computer science at the K-12 educational level. One of these initiatives, the new Advanced Placement (AP) course in Computer Science Principles (CSP), was designed to introduce computer science in an engaging way, show students how computing is relevant in their lives, and to attract a diverse group of students to computing. The CSP Curriculum Framework allows for multiple implementations of the CSP course, permitting course designers to develop courses to engage and attract specific groups of students and that focus on specific themes in computing. This paper describes an approach to develop a new CSP course, CyberCSP, which integrates cybersecurity first principles throughout the course. The approach builds on an CSP course that was created from a previous collaboration between the Computer Science Department at Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York, and the Webster Central School District in Webster, New York. The paper discusses the background, details of the earlier CSP course, how relevant cybersecurity content was identified, and then integrated into the CSP course to create the CyberCSP variant of the Computer Science Principles course.","","978-1-5090-5920-1","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190711","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190711","","Computer science;Collaboration;Employment;Computer crime","","1","","20","IEEE","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While some academic departments incorporate software like R or Python in coursework and research, many students remain reliant on self-teaching in order to gain the necessary skills to work with their data. However, given the growing number of students interested in computational tools and resources for research automation, relying on student self-teaching and learning is not an efficient method for training the next generation of scholars. To address the educational need for computational thinking and learning across various academic departments on campus, the UC San Diego Library has been running Software Carpentry workshops (two day bootcamps to introduce foundational programming concepts and best practices) since 2015. The Library, as a discipline-agnostic entity with a history of serving as a trusted resource for information, has been well positioned to provide training for this new era of research methodology. The core of our success is the collaboration with the growing community of Software and Data Carpentry instructors at UC San Diego with expertise in various research disciplines. Building on this strong partnership and leveraging the Library's resources and expertise in digital literacy, the campus can better support data-driven and technologically-focused education and research.","","978-1-7281-2451-3","10.1109/eScience.2019.00100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9041701","library,;Carpentries;reproducibility;data;training;workshops;instruction;python","Conferences;Libraries;Training;Software;Organizations;Tools","","1","","2","IEEE","19 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Teachers receive a stipend and tablets for their classrooms; they attend several in-person PD sessions through the year, where master teachers and PD facilitators introduce modeling of inquiry and equity-based practices, as well as teach the App Inventor tool and how to inculcate computational thinking in students. Project evaluation has included teacher interviews, classroom and PD observations, as well as student and teacher surveys. External evaluation of this project has been an integral part of the project from the beginning and, along with the project team’s observations and input, has significantly reshaped the project activities. It became clear after the first year that a central challenge of this project would be working with a mix of teachers across multiple domains – from teachers who had little experience even using computers to teachers who had computer science degrees; from teachers who came to teaching from professional backgrounds to those who had education degrees; and from beginning teachers to those who had been teaching the same courses for twenty years. Through evaluation data and really listening to teacher feedback, we not only tailored the PD content and structure, but also refined the data collection instruments and evaluation design to bridge the gap between different teacher experiences and levels of preparation. As a result, we have been able to bring computing into non-technical content areas such as Hospitality and non-programming classes such as Photography, as well as support computing educations in New Hampshire CTE programs. In Year 4, we now better understand the range of benefits and challenges involved in working with CTE programs and inserting CCC-inspired curricular modules in non-computing courses.","","978-1-5386-1363-4","10.1109/RESPECT.2018.8491714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491714","teacher professional learning;career and technocal edcuation;inquiry and equity-based teaching professional development evaluation","Education;Handheld computers;Engineering profession;Programming profession;Photography;Interviews;Instruments","","1","","","IEEE","14 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Biomedical engineering enjoys higher rates of women's enrollment than other engineering disciplines, but nevertheless has gender disparities in persistence within the field. Additionally, trends towards greater incorporation of computation into biomedical engineering have the potential to recreate the gender inequities seen in more computationally intensive engineering disciplines. Recently, `engineering identity' has emerged as a powerful analytic lens to understand persistence in engineering, particularly for underrepresented groups such as women. However, there is limited work examining how experiences using computational methods influences engineering identity formation in undergraduate biomedical engineers. Further, it remains unclear to what extent gender differentially mediates the effects of computational practice on engineering identity formation. In order to explore the intersection of these issues, we study a thermodynamics course in the biomedical engineering department of a large Midwestern public research institution in the United States. The thermodynamics course includes in-class computational modeling group activities and has an enrollment of more than 120, primarily sophomore year, undergraduate students. We use a qualitative study approach that includes gathering data through classroom observation and detailed semi-structured interviews. We analyze classroom observation data to try to understand student experiences of learning and participation during in-class computational modeling exercises. Specifically, we look for evidence of gendered differences in task sorting and engagement with the exercise. Classroom data is complemented by semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews gains student's perspectives on how gender has influenced their learning experience and their identity as engineers.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-1746-1","10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028656","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028656","computation;engineering identity;gender","","","1","","15","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The trained model has achieved a test accuracy of 76.0%. The results showed that focus increased at the beginning of the first 10 minutes of class and then began to decline. With the decline of focus emotion, students' neutral emotions increased. We found that when a new teaching session is performed, or the teaching method of naming questions is used, the students' emotion of focus increases briefly, lasting about 8–10 minutes. Subsequently, even if the varied teaching method was used to stimulate students' attention, their level of engagement did not increase significantly. It can be suggested that teachers can use teaching methods appropriately to promote students' attention.

Curriculum, using visual language as the motivational context with embedded computer science content was utilized in one college computer science class and two middle school technology classes. From the data collected in these three classes over the course of a semester, associated learning progressions were computed from several computational thinking patterns. By comparing the results (learning progressions), some obvious and some not so obvious indications emerged. We believe that the more obvious indications give credence to the less obvious, and hence the measurement tool. This comparison between middle school students and college students demonstrated that middle school students' learning progressions are slower than college level students (obvious), but middle school students' learning skill scores reached/surpassed the entry level scores of students in the college class after designing only two or more games. Consequently, these results tell us that this measurement tool although not validated yet, could measure accumulated learning in certain contexts. Although this is just the first ""outing"" of this tool these results strongly indicate that the tool provides an accurate measure of the concept, in this case, learning accumulation or transfer.

During this activity, students are required to work in small groups before in-class activities to answer open-ended questions related to the course learning materials via an online shared document. Based on teachers' duty, there are four stages for implementation of the proposed activity which are: (1) initiation: teacher needs to design open-ended questions and creates online shared editable documents for each group; (2) scaffolding: teacher assists learners in providing responses by checking their editing logs; (3) assessment: students' access to the online shared documents will be suspended and teacher will evaluate students responses; and (4) reflection: teacher will address common issues and propose more challenging questions before the related in-class activities. We have conducted experiments in the third cohort of a flipped general education course on computational thinking and algorithms. Except for the proposed class activity, the first two cohorts of this course have the same design and content in three topics and therefore worked as control groups. Online interaction data of all three cohorts have been collected for a thorough comparison. Results showed that students' average lecture video access rates have improved in the third cohort compared to the first two cohorts by 49 % and 39 % respectively.

For the educational robotics classes to be executed in the most effective way, the teacher must be trained to use this tool, and from there propose and/or execute classes that use the technology to help in the teaching of curricular subjects in basic education. However, many teachers do not realize what can be possible with robotics in the classroom, and this often causes them not to choose to learn more about this technology. In this work, we developed a web system called Repo-Educ in which a teacher can access information about robotics lessons created by other teachers, generating ideas about how to apply robotics in their classroom. Using this system, it is possible to transform robotics education by combining knowledge. Even teachers who have never had contact with robotics can start using this technology in the classroom by replicating lessons that are proven to work by other teachers. The system is in the final stages of development to be made available to the educational robotics community.","2643-685X","979-8-3503-1538-7","10.1109/LARS/SBR/WRE59448.2023.10332983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10332983","Educational robotics;lesson plans;web system","Training;Robot kinematics;Conferences;Tutorials;Transforms;Motor coordination;Teamwork","","","","8","IEEE","5 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Students might not be able to focus on learning mathematics now that writing a program might be difficult for them due to debugging. In this paper, mathematics curricula that meet math standards are developed with a block-based programming platform, Roboblocky. Linkbots are utilized as robots in the curricula to teach and learn mathematics in school settings. Students learn mathematics by observing the motions of robots in simulations or on real mats. Most students improved greatly in mathematics after using the curricula.

As the country posits itself as a cyber-island with a fully developed information technology hub, it has become imperative to think about leveraging the teaching of computer science in lower secondary schools (Grades 7-9). So far, this has been limited to basic courses in computing that are essentially theory focused. This paper states that students at this stated level need to develop `computational thinking' so that they are ready for the workplace and will effectively enter the digital world. It limits itself to two key variables resource leveraging and teaching computing. In the first case, it raises arguments on programming languages, hardware and software that might apply to students in the new curriculum. In the teaching area, the paper suggests that a combination of teaching programming, inclusion and informal learning will be the possibilities to accompany students overcome the digital divide and get the opportunity to become effective as learners and trained ICT students to serve their nation.","","978-1-5386-6477-3","10.1109/ICONIC.2018.8601215","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8601215","resource leveraging;teaching;programming;software;digital divide;lower secondary;Mauritius","Education;Programming profession;Software;Computer languages;Information technology","","","","24","IEEE","6 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both approaches are developed in a practical teaching case, from a STEM Maker workshop which consisted of 15 sessions with duration 2 hours each one. Each session consisted of 4 stages: Stage 1 (Theoretical concepts), Stage 2 (Practical Example), Stage 3 (Practice) and Stage 4 (challenge). Through these four stages, the development of skills of the attendees in the areas of programming and electronics was encouraged, applying the STEM Maker strategy. From some evaluation instruments, data was collected about the development of skills of the assistants in the implementation of software and hardware instrumentation, acquired in the STEM Maker workshop. The results indicated that approximately 70% of the workshop attendees developed the necessary skills to propose solutions to problems in their current context where the application of programming and/or electronics intervenes.

But in all cases there is an effort that involves ‘financial’, ‘mathematical’, ‘quantitative’ and ‘computational’ thinking to build, test and implement models that are at the center of these financial activities. In the last decade Computational Finance (CF) has influenced the market place extensively with enormous impact on wealth building, employment opportunities, and tremendous economic growth. This field forms an ever-expanding part of the financial sector, in numerous ways today. The time is, therefore, ripe now to bring together researchers in the areas of finance using complicated financial models to solve computationally intensive problems and computer scientists having the resources and solution methodologies to solve such problems. The main goal of this workshop is to provide a timely forum for these two groups to exchange and disseminate new ideas, techniques, and research in computational finance. Strong discussions will follow the presentations and the experience could lead them into the formulation, implementation of the models used by the practitioners in financial sector.

Blended learning approaches have the potential to reduce this barrier by facilitating the distribution of expertise across distances. In this poster we present our approach to understanding how to design blended learning models for the informal space that take advantage of the expertise of adult mentors and computer science experts. Our theoretical framing is based on Nacu et al. (2014) adult mentor roles, which suggest that adults play different roles (e.g., encourager, monitor, broker) to support students learning. We use Minecraft, a popular, 3D, online, multiplayer game, as our study context. The poster presents two studies that investigate ways of facilitating mentorship in a blended learning environment to teach computational thinking. Study 1 focuses on documenting the roles mentors play while facilitating a computer science-related Minecraft workshop with middle school students. Study 2 focuses on understanding how these roles are modified when online and in person mentors work together to facilitate a computational learning opportunity. Our initial findings suggest that defining a scalable model to support blended learning models in informal spaces requires a variety of mentor roles. Additionally, when coordinating mentorship across mediums, gaps in student support can arise when there is a lack of (a) explicit strategies of communication in place between in-person and online mentors; and (b) clearly defined roles assigned to mentors.","","978-1-5090-3419-2","10.1109/RESPECT.2016.7836181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7836181","","Computer science;Computational modeling;Media;Electronic mail;Monitoring;Three-dimensional displays;Games","","","","","IEEE","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Various Computer Science assessment tests such as the SCS1, MG-CSCI, PSIv1 and the Fairy Assessment have been developed for different age groups. These tests mostly include computational thinking, programming or topics that could be categorized in the first two core topic areas data and coding and algorithms. Hence, the research desideratum was to develop a test specifically for measuring the four core topic areas.
