"Use of Augmented Reality for Computational Thinking Stimulation through Virtual","A. M. d. S. Esteves; A. L. M. Santana; R.

Also, a topic that is growing within education is Computational Thinking, which says that the thinking like computer scientists is necessary for the 21st century and should be disseminated mainly in schools during basic education. In the face of this, this work created an augmented reality android application that tracks physical tiles and creates 3D maps for the user, also giving a character that can be programmed to walk on this created map, simulating a programming toy. Finally, tests carried out with the application have shown that augmented reality currently has performance problems when multiple targets are used, so, devices with low processing have problems at map tracking. These issues affected the tests with the children, which made it difficult for them to track the map like they wanted, but they still liked the app even after it. That shows that the acceptance of the technology by the children is good, which can help developing Computational Thinking, but the technology limitation is still a problem. These obstacles while currently hindering the use of augmented reality in education may in the future be irrelevant due to the constant advancement of technology. This paper's main contribution is showing one possibility of using AR with Computational Thinking and what needs to evolve for it to be used by the usable by the children.","","978-1-7281-5434-3","10.1109/SVR.2019.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8921049","Computational Thinking;Augmented Reality;Technology in Education","Augmented reality;Education;Target tracking;Programming profession;Rendering (computer graphics);Androids","","5","","10","IEEE","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The teaching process is task-oriented, teacher-led and student-centered. In the whole teaching process, teachers use the way of integrating computational thinking with practical thinking to prepare courses, design tasks and guide students to complete learning tasks. Compared with the traditional teaching mode, the teaching mode of integrating computational thinking and practical thinking has made great progress in training students' computer practical ability and innovation ability. It can not only improve learning efficiency, but also train students' computer practical ability. Finally, the feasibility and efficiency of this method are verified by Java Web course design.","2474-3828","978-1-7281-3918-0","10.1109/ITME.2019.00078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8964889","Computational Thinking;Practical Thinking;Java Web","Java;Task analysis;Programming;Software;Training;Information technology","","3","","10","IEEE","23 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Game-based learning has recently seen an increase in prevalence for teaching computational thinking, making games an important topic of study. However, there is currently no validated tool for assessing Computational Thinking (CT) that performs reliably across disciplines and age groups. In the absence of such a tool, this paper examines several software testing methods for the evaluation of CT pedagogy effectiveness within serious games. Namely, it makes recommendations for the application of standardized questionnaires, think-aloud testing, and automated data logging for evaluating games that promote CT learning. It concludes with a potential use case to demonstrate how the methods can be combined to achieve a granular and actionable understanding of a complex CT assessment problem and its causes.","","978-1-7281-7679-6","10.1109/ICISFall51598.2021.9627365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9627365","serious games;game;gaming;computational thinking;algorithmic thinking;test;testing;assessment;development","Software testing;Information science;Bibliographies;Education;Games;Manuals;Tools","","1","","23","IEEE","6 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In spite of significant studies, investment and efforts, math skills and widespread enthusiasm for SET remain elusive. In South Africa's disadvantaged communities, poor quality maths teaching and poor maths performance, both legacies of past political engineering, further fuel marginalization. Computational thinking is a new characterization of some specific procedural thinking, abstraction, problem solving and organizational skills that are finding their way from computer science programs into other fields. The paper describes our refocus of content in BingBee, a SET skill-building kiosk project targeting disadvantaged communities. As we shift to emphasize computational thinking more explicitly, we speculate that these skills could complement, and perhaps eventually displace, some elements of maths as the dominant driver of SET. The confluence of better tools, open service interfaces, and the rapid spread of handsets and devices into marginalized communities is an opportunity to build more widespread computational thinking skills. This could in turn facilitate a future Internet which is more inclusive, and in which users are able to create their own services.","","978-1-4244-8272-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5682137","Computational thinking;problem solving;abstraction;cognitive skills;marginalized communities","Games;Internet;Computer science;Problem-solving;Educational institutions;Mathematics","","","","10","","6 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet, there is a consensus that CS has serious conundrums particularly in attracting students, low motivation for learning computer programming and developing computational thinking (CT) skills. New motivational methods are needed to take the attention of students and adapt to their learning patterns as how people learn have changed drastically over the last two decades. To address these issues, video games and video game-based tools are proposed as a primary approach for motivating and supporting students in developing their skills in CT and support their learning of introductory programming. This research is concerned with the capture of statistical evidence on the educational effectiveness of playing a serious game specifically designed to enhance the development of CT skills to facilitate learning introductory computer programming. A total of 190 students were invited to participate in a quasi-experimental pre-post study for the purpose of analyzing the impact of an adhoc game on students' confidence in learning programming constructs and using their skills in CT. All students were studying a CS degree at the time and they were all registered to a first-year computer programming course. 151 out of 190 students successfully completed the study and the findings suggest that a) the intrinsic motivation to learn programming; b) students' perception of their knowledge and their tangible knowledge in key programming constructs (i.e. programming sequence, methods, decision making and loops); and c) students' confidence in using their CT skills were all statistically and significantly improved after playing the game. Additionally, students perceived computer programming significantly less difficult in their post study responses when compared to their pre study responses.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3043278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9286386","Computational thinking;serious games;computer programming;video game design;game-based learning;gamification","Programming profession;Games;Visualization;Tools;Syntactics;Education;Computer languages","","29","","98","CCBY","8 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based upon constructivist problem-solving learning strategies and supported by a three-dimensional framework, a game-based environment with both individual and collaborative playing modes has been developed as a learning and an assessment tool via learning analytics. Moreover, an exploratory case study has been carried out involving 176 primary school students. Results suggest that this environment is suitable as a learning and assessment tool for CT skills in primary school, providing enduring learning, particularly when it engages the collaborative playing mode. It seems to be better adapted to early primary school stage students, who showed greater improvements and who were able to assimilate more computational concepts than expected. Likewise, special needs or low percentile students benefit even more greatly from the learning tool and especially from the collaborative playing mode.

At the same time, tools such as notebooks and interactive apps designed to support the teaching of programming concepts are becoming ever more popular. However, in non-CS majors, CT might not be perceived as essential, and students might lack the motivation to engage with such tools in order to acquire solid CT skills. This article presents a field study conducted with 115 students during a full semester on a novel computational notebook environment. It evaluates computational notebooks and CT skills in an introductory course on information technology for first-year undergraduates in business and economics. A multidimensional evaluation approach makes use of pre- and post-test surveys, lectures, and self-directed laboratory sessions tracking analytics. Our findings suggest that, in the process of learning CT for non-CS students, engagement in active learning activities can be a stronger determinant of learning outcomes than initial knowledge.

The novel method applied in the project, entitled Sprego (Spreadsheet Lego), is a concept-based problem-solving approach adapted from the didactics of other sciences and computer programming. In the experimental group contextualized, real-world programming problems are presented in a spreadsheet environment. A semi-unplugged data-driven analysis is carried out based on each problem, which is followed by the building of a feasible algorithm, expressed by natural language expressions. The coding is completed in the following step by applying a limited number of spreadsheet (Sprego) functions, multilevel, and array formulas. The final steps of the process are discussion and debugging. On the other hand, classical, tool-centered approaches are applied in the control groups. Our research reveals that the traditional surface approach methods for teaching spreadsheeting do not provide long lasting, reliable knowledge which would provide students and end-users with effective problem-solving strategies, while Sprego does. Beyond this finding, the project proves that Sprego supports schema construction and extended abstraction, which is one of the major hiatus points of traditional surface navigation methods. The project also reveals that developing computational thinking skills should not be downgraded, and the misconceptions of self-taught end-users and user-friendly applications should be reconsidered, especially their application in educational environments. Gaining effective computer problem-solving skills and knowledge-transfer abilities is not magic, but a time-consuming process which requires consciously developed and effective methods, and teachers who accept the incremental nature of the sciences.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3126757","construction(grant numbers:EFOP-3.6.3-VEKOP-16-2017-00002); European Union through the European Social Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9606871","Algorithm-driven spreadsheeting;long lasting knowledge;schema construction;cognitive load;end-user computing;computational thinking","Programming profession;Education;Problem-solving;Informatics;Mathematics;Task analysis","","4","","128","CCBY","8 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, previous studies has shown little agreement among researchers, governmental and non-governmental sectors about a unified CT definition. These dissensions have introduced challenges in formulating a definition for CT at the K-12 level. The absence of a unified definition may increase the challenges for teachers to teach and integrate CT into school curriculum. To foster CT among K-12 students, we introduce a definition and framework for CT. We evaluated 39 articles and extracted the most common elements used in the literature to frame CT definition and describe its elements. Several studies have discussed, as well as investigated, the significance of conceptualizing and comprehending the interaction and dependency relationships among computational objects. However, our literature review discovered that little attention has been dedicated to the concept of dependency in the CT body of knowledge. Based on the literature review, we define CT as the thought process used for solving problems, and it encompasses the elements of problem decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking. We conjecture the CT definition is missing the element of dependency. In the context of CT, we define dependency as the knowledge of comprehending the interrelationships between different sections of a decomposed problem.","2165-9567","978-1-6654-4434-7","10.1109/EDUCON52537.2022.9766703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9766703","Computational Thinking (CT);K-12 Education;Dependency;Abstraction;Decomposition;Algorithmic Thinking","Computer science;Bibliographies;Conferences;Computational modeling;Engineering education","","","","69","IEEE","11 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Game-based learning assessments (GBLA) are able to assess tacit knowledge by avoiding jargon in test items., constructing irrelevant material., and reducing anxiety., avoiding the barriers of traditional assessments in assessing students' abilities. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT., it is necessary to integrate diverse problem-solving contexts using a digital game-based assessment model to measure CT.

For many students the subject of computer science concerns software code but writing code can be challenging, due to specific requirements on syntax and spelling with new ways of thinking required. Not only do many undergraduate students lack these ways of thinking, but there is a general misrepresentation of computing in education. Were computing taught as a more serious subject like science and mathematics, public understanding of the complexities of computer systems would increase, enabling those not directly involved with IT make better informed decisions and avoid incidents such as over budget and underperforming systems. We present our exploration into teaching a variety of computing skills, most significantly ""computational thinking"", to secondary-school age children through three very different engagements.

The kindergarten version, called TechCheck-K, consists of similar unplugged challenges but reduces the number of response choices from four to three and uses exclusively non-verbal material in the responses to accommodate younger, pre-literate children. We administered TechCheck-K to N =89 kindergarten students from four schools, including 45 boys and 44 girls with no coding experience. Participants completed the assessment in an average of 23.43 minutes. TechCheck-K scores were normally distributed (M =8.26, SD =2.33). Mean scores were numerically higher in boys (M =8.71, SD = 2.69) than girls (M =8.05, SD = 2.07). The difference between genders was not significant. The pattern of correct responses to the 15 TechCheck-K items correlated (r =.76) with the pattern observed in first and second graders on the original TechCheck, providing evidence that comparable CT constructs are measured by the two versions of the instrument. Results of this pilot study indicate that TechCheck-K has acceptable characteristics for assessment of CT in kindergarten children.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-8478-4","10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453926","Computational thinking;Assessment;Unplugged;Computer Science;Early Childhood Education","Instruments;Conferences;Encoding;Engineering education","","13","","33","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the lack of a consensual definition of CT and the confusion with other similar terms made it a big challenge for researchers and practitioners to understand this concept. The purpose of this work-in-progress (WIP) is to identify and compare the existing definitions of CT proposed by various members of the education or research community, and ultimately to give educators and researchers suggestions on understanding this concept for particular purposes or situations. We conducted a systematic review of the definitions of CT from the source of academic articles and categorized the definitions based on their approaches, dimensions, and contexts. Forty-one unique and original concepts were extracted from the search. Results indicate that the existing definitions of CT were mostly formulated 1) with a prototype approach, 2) for the generic purpose of use, 3) in the context of K-12 education, 4) based on the subject of Computer Science. These results provide sufficient granularity to allow us to come up with suggestions on how to choose appropriate and pragmatic CT definitions.","2330-331X","978-1-6654-1383-1","10.1109/ISEC52395.2021.9764144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9764144","Computational Thinking;Algorithmic Thinking;Educational Curriculum;Operational Definition;Systematic review","Computer science;Systematics;Conferences;Education;Prototypes;Pragmatics","","2","","33","IEEE","29 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our project prepares in-service and pre-service elementary teachers to integrate CT into their science lessons. While our overall goal was to increase CT access for all students, we found some teachers enacted CT in ways that did not always provide equal access to all students. Although our professional development adopted a CS for All approach, without explicit supports, a group of teachers implemented CT in ways often upholding the current trends of inequity and power structures within CS. Our findings suggest teachers would benefit from explicit support to provide opportunities for students currently underrepresented in CS and to offer more equitable opportunities to students regardless of their CS background.","","978-1-7281-7172-2","10.1109/RESPECT49803.2020.9272488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272488","computational thinking;professional development;equity;computer science education;science education","Education;Encoding;Tools;Programming profession;Statistics;Sociology;Production","","2","","8","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The interaction and interface of this application is designed using user-centered design approach in ISO 9241210:2010. In order to make this application useful for children, it should be effective to use, easy to learn, and enjoyable. Those three things are the usability and user experience goals of this application. Usability testing is conducted to validate the achievement of the goals by using several metrics, such as completion rate, Single Ease Question (SEQ), System Usability Scale (SUS), and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory for interest/enjoyment subscale. The completion rate is 97,4 %/100% for usability goal effective to use, the SEQ score is 6,12/7 and the SUS score is 70,5/100 for usability goal learnability, and the IMI interest/enjoyment subscale score is 6,02/7 for user experience goal enjoyable.

This course was based on materials developed from a previous program that trained high school teachers in computational thinking and programming through LSU's Cain Center. Pedagogical content knowledge informed the design of this course. Also, data gathered from teacher and instructor interaction at multiple sites during the summer STEM professional development program contributed to the courses' design. The CS Methods course targeted undergraduate computer science majors who were considering a career in teaching or who were interested in CS pedagogy. We encountered several challenges recruiting and retaining students and found that computer science students attracted to teaching careers do not fall into the stereotype of most computer science majors. Participation of women was higher than the average undergraduate CS courses. A disconnect appeared between the pedagogical practices promoted for teaching computing at the high school level and those being practiced at the college level. After learning about the 5E pedagogical model for teaching computing, students expressed interest in the potential of using more student-centered instruction, not only for high school instruction, but also for their own college courses. An area of disconnect also emerged in the programming formats, as all the students were comfortable with Java but all were unfamiliar with popular block-based programming platforms, such as Scratch. The transition from the CS curriculum taught in high schools to what follows in college needs to be smoother.","","978-1-7281-7172-2","10.1109/RESPECT49803.2020.9272455","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272455","computational thinking;computer science teachers;Research Practitioner Partnership","Programming profession;Computational modeling;Training;STEM;Encoding;Planning;Interviews","","1","","3","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CT is an important element for the expansion of computer software, along with providing the huge support to problem solving skills across all disciplines of education like engineering, science, humanities and K12 education. It gives a logical idea to the students to solve a problem systematically using algorithm development, flowchart design and programming and problem-solving skills. CT increases the confidence among students in dealing with complexity of difficult problems, the capacity to handle complex issues and collaborate with others to find a shared purpose or solution. In this research paper, authors discuss the impact of CT among the students of different specialization of engineering and K12 by using different problem-solving techniques and strategies such as modeling, making sub goals, pruning and searching so that students will be able to think differently towards new problems.","","978-1-6654-9707-7","10.1109/ICIRCA54612.2022.9985593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9985593","Computational thinking;Problem solving skills;Flowcharts;K12 education","Flowcharts;Humanities;Computational modeling;Software algorithms;Data visualization;Search problems;Software","","1","","18","IEEE","29 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main instructional tool for this course is the BEAM robot, a robotics paradigm that proposes simple robots whose behavior can be controlled without software programming. The programming of this robot is implicit in its morphology, so its actions and goals are codified from its construction. A three-phase curriculum is designed to achieve the objective: propaedeutic, robot assembly, and CT. On the basis of these phases, the course is constructed modularly and implemented virtually, while students receive construction kits. Each phase aims to foster the many facets of CT, such as decomposition, abstraction, algorithm, debugging, iteration, and generalization. Students’ responses to pre-and post-course surveys, as well as evaluation activities and logs, are analyzed to determine the course’s impact on them. In addition to other STEM disciplines (electrical, electronic, mechanical, and WEEE), the course substantially improves the CT.","","978-1-7281-6715-2","10.1109/CONCAPAN48024.2022.9997660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9997660","STEM;BEAM;Computational Thinking;WEEE;Educational robotics","Morphology;Debugging;Organizations;Programming;Electronic waste;Software;Behavioral sciences","","","","20","IEEE","29 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
