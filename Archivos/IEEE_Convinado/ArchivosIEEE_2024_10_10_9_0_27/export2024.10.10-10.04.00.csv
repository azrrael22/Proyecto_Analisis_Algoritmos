"How do Bebras Tasks Explore Algorithmic Thinking Skill in a Computational Thinking Contest?","A. L. S. Oliveira; W. L. Andrade; D. D. S. Guerrero; M. R. A.

Numerous studies in the last decade shed light on disseminating CT practices. However, there is still a gap in understanding CT as a construct, that is, CT as a complex cognitive dimension. Furthermore, few studies analyze how many constructs can be recognized inside CT by empirical data. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is one of the essential skills in CT, even when we do not apply programming activities. In this exploratory paper, we investigate the Bebras Challenge tasks. Our primary aim is to figure out how many and which are the constructs associated with CT skills derived from data, especially related to algorithmic thinking. The results point out three primary constructs supported by data. We claim that these constructs are a mix of CT skills, mainly algorithmic thinking, abstraction, generalization, evaluation, and pattern recognition. In addition, our study provides additional evidence supporting the idea that algorithmic thinking can be explored by different perspectives beyond “a set of order instructions”, even without programming practices. Thus, this result reinforces the notion that CT can be understood as a mix of several skills to solve problems. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is a complex cognitive process of thought which may be explored through different strategies. We believe that these findings may help recognize which constructs and abilities underline CT, primarily algorithmic thinking without programming activities.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637151","","Cognitive processes;Conferences;Pattern recognition;Task analysis;Programming profession","","2","","27","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, an investigation to study the effectiveness and suitability of an unplugged CT activities has been carried out. This is part of the unplugged CT framework development process, where the first element investigated is the type of suitable activities. Two iterations were conducted to confirm the suitability of the activities. The activities were also verified with a selected group of secondary school teachers. The results have shown that unplugged activities can be effective in helping students to learn programming capability. The next step of the research is to identify other relevant components relevant to the framework for an unplugged CT activities for novice programmer.","","978-1-6654-3689-2","10.1109/ICOCO53166.2021.9673537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9673537","","Computers;Computer languages;Conferences;Education;Problem-solving;IEEE activities;Programming profession","","1","","31","IEEE","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most existent autograders are based on unit testing, which focuses on the correctness of the code, but has limited scope for judging code quality. Moreover, it is cumbersome to implement unit testing for evaluating graphical output code. We propose an autograder that can effectively judge the code quality of the visual output codes created by students enrolled in a high school-level computational thinking course. We aim to provide suggestions to teachers on an essential aspect of their grading, namely the level of student com-petency in using abstraction within their codes. A dataset from five different assignments, including open-ended problems, is used to evaluate the effectiveness of our autograder. Our initial experiments show that our method can classify the students' submissions even for open-ended problems, where existing autograders fail to do so.

The model blends six critical types of thinking, i.e., logical thinking, systems thinking, sustainable thinking, strategic thinking, creative thinking, and responsible thinking into the design of a first-year undergraduate programming course. The study describes a creative blended pedagogy that embeds the proposed model into the course plan. Background: The emergence of artificial intelligent systems such as large language models from a knowledge provider perspective, coupled with a gradual change in post-pandemic outlook of education challenge the relevance and raises concerns about the future of education. The 21st-century human CT requirements, viz., learning to code (skill) and thinking computationally (competency), will be inadequate in the future. Moreover, there is substantial evidence which shows that most introductory programming courses fail to integrate critical elements like ethics and responsibility as part of the course. Intended Outcomes: The authors anticipate experiential learning models such as this has immense potential to future-proof CS education, as well as make future software engineers responsible citizens. Application Design: The proposed model blends six types of thinking into the design and activities of the course. The underlying theoretical basis of these activities revolve around three key principles: 1) experiential learning; 2) self-reflection; and 3) peer learning. Findings: This case study from a liberal educational institution in India qualitatively shows evidence of students developing six critical elements of thinking that shapes their future CT ability.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2024.3394060","seed fund given to Kalluri’s Urban Design and Open-innovation Studio (KUDOS) at FLAME University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10530940","21st-century skills;computer science (CS);creative pedagogy;foundational education;future thinking","Education;Sustainable development;Computational modeling;Systems thinking;Programming profession;Software systems;Green products","","","","","IEEE","15 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In the paper, we comprehensively reviewed the concepts of CT in the theoretical literature of CT, aiming to construct the comprehensive and effective evaluation indicators of CT for students by clustering the keywords of CT concepts and extracting indicators. The validity of indicators is verified by qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis and expert evaluation. The results show that the evaluation indicators of CT constructed by spectral clustering technology are a more scientific, more comprehensive reflection of the ability dimensions of CT.

When nurturing identity and empowerment, it is a persistent challenge to provide youth with real-world experiences and suitable development tools. This paper advances two key approaches to address these issues: 1) A critical computational literacy approach to engage youth in developing personally meaningful applications that have impact in the real world; 2) the use of a tool, like MIT App Inventor, that lowers barriers to creating useful, impactful technology. Using two case-based studies, we show how these two approaches have supported youth in developing applications that respond to meaningful challenges in their communities and helped them to establish their computational identities and digital empowerment.","2165-9567","978-1-5090-5467-1","10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7943078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943078","computational thinking;digital empowerment;computational identity","Computer languages;Tools;Encoding;Context;Engineering education;Conferences","","15","","16","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Early educational programming languages such as Logo have made programming substantially more accessible to end-users. More recent approaches include visual programming with a drag-and-drop style of programming that makes it nearly impossible to compose syntactically incorrect programs. However, as the syntactic challenges of end-user programming are gradually fading into the past, the new frontier of semantic programming support emerges.

GSCP applies principles of pervasive computing to evaluate load conditions of core resources, and then integrates the fundamental principles of gang scheduling, processor affinity and load balancing to define the flexible and robust decision framework and scheduling algorithm set. Those are intended to improve the performance of CTLS, and strive for balance among through capacity for vessels and containers, task latency and load leveling as well.

Also, the association between coding attitude and CT performance was investigated. A total of 217 elementary students were involved.

This research investigates the reduction of cognitive load in CT based learning system than non-computational (NCT) learning way more accurately after doing a particular task within a scheduled training. But for the measurement of the cognitive load instantly no platform is used before. To overcome this problem the ultimate goal of this paper is to construct a MATLAB GUI for immediately measurement of electroencephalography (EEG) based cognitive load individually. To measure the amount of cognitive load EEG signal was acquired from the two-class participants during the strategically question task and resting state. Preprocessing steps along with power spectral density were extracted to calculate the theta/beta ratio which strongly correlates with cognitive load. By seeing the fluctuation curve of theta beta ratio students learning ability can be determined. All these steps would be possible with the help of MATLAB GUI immediately by pushing button.","","978-0-7381-2323-3","10.1109/ICAICT51780.2020.9333485","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9333485","Computational thinking;Cognitive Load;Electroencephalography (EEG);Theta/Beta;MATLAB GUI","Learning systems;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Graphical user interfaces;Matlab","","3","","12","IEEE","1 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To improve student engagement in quantitative based course like Math, Accounting or Science; it is of supreme importance that students are able to make connections between knowledge and its application to a real world context. Two such cases of Contextual Learning have been presented in this paper which was modeled in implementation of interdisciplinary projects across Accounting and IT disciplines, with Business students enrolled in Managerial Accounting and Cost Accounting courses and CIS students in Mobile Application course and ICT. This study aims at presenting a contextual strategy used to enhance Accounting and IT skills in Undergraduate students at Dubai Women's College, Higher Colleges of Technology. We posited that through this contextualized approach, students would see Accounting, Computational thinking and app development as tools for solving work-related problems. Using Constructivist teaching and REACT (relating, experience, application, collaboration and transfer) strategy; we initiated curriculum integration of both Accounting and IT, which deviates from traditional teaching model where learning of a subjects is isolated from any context. We conclude that the interdisciplinary projects implemented were a robust technique for application of contextual learning.

The reactive nature of this approach means that systems just react to what they are currently sensing, they do not need to have a perfect model of the world, and they can easily respond to external changes in the world. This resilience makes behavior-based systems perfect for real world robotics use. When developers chose this approach for Kodu, the hope was that this resilience would help minimize the potential frustration of young users. This paper introduces the Kodu developers' strategy, results and future plans in developing a user-friendly programming environment that successfully introduces children in a fun and easy way to the fundamental concepts of computer science and computational thinking.","","978-1-4673-8367-7","10.1109/BLOCKS.2015.7368999","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7368999","Kodu;rule-based formalism;computational thinking","Robot sensing systems;Programming;Graphical user interfaces;Games;Programming environments","","1","","14","IEEE","4 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially in educational settings, children are exposed to computational thinking by making games, building scientific simulations and creating stories. Early educational programming languages such as Logo have made programming substantially more accessible to end users. More recent approaches include visual programming with drag-and-drop style of programming making it nearly impossible to compose syntactically incorrect programs. However, as the syntactic challenges of end-user programming are gradually fading into the past, the new frontier of semantic programming support emerges. This demonstration introduces Future Trace, a system to make programming more conversational. A conversational programming agent runs programs one step into the future in order to visualize discrepancies between the programs users intended to write and the actual programs.","1943-6106","978-1-4577-1247-0","10.1109/VLHCC.2011.6070423","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6070423","Game design;computational thinking;debugging;end-user programming;visual programming","Programming profession;Games;Debugging;Programming environments;Visualization;Educational institutions","","1","","3","IEEE","10 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These practices are not only essential for the development of knowledge in STEM, but also in Computer Science disciplines. Recently, arguments have been standing in favour of the early integration of programming within compulsory education. The international scientific community is looking forward to researching and initiatives being deployed towards this direction.

As an orientation step to personalize this goal and understand it within the context of their own classrooms and schools, teachers on the Inclusive CT Committee conducted empathy interviews to learn more about the computing experiences of their students. Teachers reflected upon the structure of the interview protocol, the insights they gained, and the potential opportunities the approach afforded them to address misconceptions about computing. They described the interviews as opportunities to learn more about designing supports, on-ramps, and more inclusive computing opportunities for students.","","978-1-6654-4905-2","10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620708","computing pathways;computational thinking;empathy interviews;inclusive computing","Computer science;Protocols;Instruments;Urban areas;Interviews","","","","9","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education pathways increasingly develop in rural districts, it is essential to provide quality PD for their teachers so they can identify opportunities for and plan to embed CS and CT learning in their classrooms. A key element in delivering high-quality PD is understanding the specific educational and wider cultural needs of the community where it will be delivered, something we call “mining cultural capital”. In this poster, we report on the delivery of four 30-minute virtual PD sessions within two rural school districts in Eastern Kentucky: Pikeville Independent and Floyd County Schools. The virtual sessions were specifically geared toward elementary and middle school teachers. The sessions were led by a long-time educator in the region who worked to curate relevant examples and delivered the PD via a recorded video conference. The recordings are available for teachers in the region to watch and re-watch as they develop their lessons. Survey results showed that participating teachers found the PD to be valuable. Furthermore, feedback from teachers suggests that access to these short just-in-time PD sessions provided valuable learning opportunities and also sparked new lesson ideas for teachers.","","978-1-6654-4905-2","10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620568","rural education;computing pathways;equitable access to computer science education;computational thinking;professional development;broadening participation in computing","Computer science;Handheld computers;Education;Global communication;Cultural differences;Videoconferences","","","","7","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we describe how our research-practice partnership is working to motivate, prepare, and support an elementary school to integrate equitable and inclusive computer science into core curriculum. Data were collected from teachers at a K-5 school where 65 % of students are Hispanic or Latinx, 46% are English Learners, and 65 % are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Data included semi-structured interviews, educators' written reflections, and observations of classroom implementation and professional development. The findings show how the school is building buy-in and capacity among teachers by using a coaching cycle led by a Teacher on Special Assignment. The cycle of preparation, implementation, and reflection demystifies CS by helping teachers design, test, and revise coherent lesson sequences that integrate CT into their lessons. Contrasting case studies are used to illustrate what teachers learned from the cycle, including the teachers' reasons for the integration, adaptations they made to promote equity, what the teachers noticed about their students engaging in CT, and their next steps.

Offering efficient educational games that promote computational thinking competencies requires personalized learning paths through adaptive difficulty. The research presented herein is a first attempt to define a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges using log data obtained from Kodetu, which is a block-based maze game. Specifically, we conducted three studies with 9- to 16-year-old students who were asked to solve sequences of maze-based programming challenges. Using log data from these studies, we investigated the maze characteristics and the coding limitations that affect performance in the challenges and calculated the performance obtained by the participants using a fuzzy rule-based system. The results showed that the turns in a maze, the number of total steps of a maze, and the blocks provided affect student performance. Using regression analysis, we defined a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges that considers the weights of these factors and provides a first step towards the design of adaptive learning paths for computational thinking-related educational games.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3075027","European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program through the Marie Sklodowska-Curie(grant numbers:665959); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9410541","Computational thinking;difficulty;educational games;block-based maze game","Games;Programming profession;Tools;Extraterrestrial measurements;Particle measurements;Atmospheric measurements;Visualization","","4","","59","CCBY","22 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On one hand it is an effort to guide convergence in the literature, leading to more standardized definitions and spotting similarities or disagreements between authors. And on the other hand, it is a platform for sharing resources and experiences between the communities, an initiative to bring the model of research with public participation (Citizen Science) to education. An expandable ontology that is able to consider the perspective of multiple authors over the subjects is used to implement the model. Three different author views and resources are instantiated to illustrate the range, expressiveness and operation of the ontology.

Students solved visual design problems by creating 3D sculptures in an online virtual environment. These creations were further explored and refined in immersive display systems fostering embodied learning and remote peer presence and support. To achieve the desired design, students use programming and computing concepts, such as loops, to solve those visual design centered problems, i.e. solving for composition, positive/negative space, balance, as opposed to computational problems first, i.e. create a loop, a fractal, randomized lines, etc. We present results from a study conducted on three high school summer courses. We compared the use of our Visual Design Problem-based teaching strategy (students wrote code to solve challenges based on art and design principles) to a traditional strategy (students wrote code to demonstrate comprehension of computer science concepts). Our results showed that test scores were higher for students in our Visual Design Problem-based courses. This work may have a positive impact on computer science education by increasing engagement, knowledge acquisition, and self-directed learning.","2642-5254","978-1-7281-1377-7","10.1109/VR.2019.8798013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8798013","Visual Design Problem-based Pedagogy;problem-based learning;Online Virtual Environments;Embodied Learning;Virtual Sculpting;Increase Programming Knowledge;Spatial Art;CCS [Human-centered Computing]: Human-computer interaction (HCI);Interaction paradigms-Virtual Reality;[Human-centered Computing]: CCS Human-computer interaction (HCI);Empirical studies in HCI","Art;Visualization;Virtual environments;Programming profession;Three-dimensional displays","","12","","23","IEEE","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the concept of computational logistics for CTLS is proposed above all, and then the instruction sets, resource constraints, and operating environments for CTLS abstract machines are defined on the basis of the similarities and differences between computer systems and CTLS. Subsequently, CTLS are discussed from the perspective of asymmetric single-ISA multi-core processors (AMP) in detail within the conceptual framework of computational logistics and generalized computing. Consequently, a container terminal computational logistics model is presented with computing architecture and central properties of AMP. Finally, the proposed approach is demonstrated and validated by investigating through capacity, task latency and load balancing of a typical container terminal logistics service case with a comprehensive scheduling algorithm that is a composite of multifarious classical decision thinking and algorithms.","","978-1-4799-7886-1","10.1109/CDC.2015.7402222","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7402222","","Containers;Logistics;Computational modeling;Marine vehicles;Complexity theory;Computers;Planning","","11","","10","IEEE","11 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent studies conducted in the US have shown that not only do high school students lack any exposure, but also they possess ill-conceived notions of what computer science is, a problem also affecting their parents, teachers and regional school superintendents. For incoming students, the extent to which computing technology impacts their daily lives is very likely at odds with the extent to which they have considered how software works and its ethical implications. The ability to critically analyze and consider related ethical consequences of computing is an important life skill for every twenty-first century adult and not just computer scientists. With this this in mind, this paper presents a unique CS0 introduction to programming and computer ethics for pre CS and non majors. It has been defined as a service course to promote digital literacy and to ensure that students appreciate what computer science is and its socio-ethical implications. The paper outlines the course and its content in detail, as well as providing quantitative and qualitative evidence of its benefit and appeal to female students.","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757436","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757436","Computer Science Education;ethics;programming;digital literacy","Computers;Programming profession;Ethics;Problem-solving;Education","","8","","29","IEEE","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In previous research with AgentSheets, we concluded that the semiotic richness of this visual programming environment, specifically designed to support computational thinking acquisition, could be explored more extensively to the benefit of learners. In particular, we realized that there are some additional representations of AgentSheets games and simulations that are not presented as programming tools in the interface, and yet they communicate new relevant meanings to the users. This paper reports on research where we artificially introduced such representations in a small follow-up experiment with selected participants from our previous research experiment. Our goal was to investigate the impact of such additional representations on program comprehension and modification tasks. To this end we contrasted empirical evidence of their performance in the two tasks with their verbal account of experience with AgentSheets. We used a combination of discourse analysis and inspections using Semiotic Engineering methods and the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework. Our findings go in two directions. First, we observed that additional representations have allowed participants to expand and correct previous learning. Therefore such representations can support new teaching strategies in computational thinking acquisition programs with AgentSheets. Second, we learned that the combination of methods we used to analyze empirical data - discourse analysis with semiotic and cognitive inspection techniques - can be used systematically in other research contexts, holding the promise of insightful results.","1943-6106","978-1-4673-0853-3","10.1109/VLHCC.2012.6344492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6344492","computational thinking;end-user programming;visual programming;cognitive dimentions of notations;semiotic engineering methods","Visualization;Games;Semiotics;Programming;Marine animals;Interviews;Inspection","","6","","12","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problems that are used in the competition also have been adapted into a game. The game aims to help student practicing for the competition, but the game still has several limitations to be used by Indonesian students. Therefore, this paper researches similar games design interaction that suits Indonesian students, particularly for upper elementary school students. The type of the game is a serious game that has the main goal of learning. An approach of user-centered design was used to develop the design interaction.

However, the integration of computing remains obstructed by resources and lack of professional development to support students' learning. Further challenging is students' STEM attitudes and interest do not matriculate with them into higher education. This issue is especially critical for traditionally under represented and underserved populations including females, racial/ethnic minority groups, and students of low-socioeconomic status (SES). To help mitigate challenges, we developed an unplugged (computer-less) computing engineering and robotics lesson composed of two introductory computing concepts, sequencing and decision-making, using a small robot arm and tangible programming blocks. Through students' sequencing of operations, debugging, and executing complex robotic behavior, we seek to determine if students' interest or attitudes change toward engineering. Nine one-hour introductory pilot lessons with 148 students, grades 6-10, at two public middle schools, and one summer camp were conducted. We measured students' engineering interest and attitudes through a 15 question pre- and post-lesson survey and calculated aggregate factor scores for interest and attitudes. We found low-SES students' a priori interests and attitudes tend to be lower and more varied than those of their high-SES peers. These preliminary results suggest that the integration of introductory computing and robotics lessons in low-SES classrooms may help students reach similar levels of engineering interest and attitudes as their high-SES peers.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8658959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658959","robotics;computational thinking;K-12","Robot sensing systems;Debugging;Programming profession;Education","","13","","27","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Educational games hold significant potential to serve as a platform for CS education because they integrate engaging problem solving with effective pedagogical strategies. This potential is especially high for narrative-centered educational games that embed learning activities within rich interactive stories. In this paper, we present an educational game featuring block-based programming challenges contextualized within an engaging narrative, designed to promote CS learning for middle school students (ages 11 to 13). In the game, students undertake problem-solving challenges that are aligned with the K-12 Computer Science Framework. Results from a classroom implementation of the game with middle grade students suggest that their perceived game control ratings are positively correlated with their progress in the game, which suggests the need for adaptively supporting students' game-based learning activities. Building on these findings, we discuss design implications for creating student-adaptive CS learning experiences in educational games that incorporate block-based programming enriched narrative-centered gameplay.","2325-4289","978-1-7281-4533-4","10.1109/CoG47356.2020.9231881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9231881","Game-based learning;Computer science education;Computational thinking;Block-based programming","Games;Programming profession;Education;Task analysis;Problem-solving;Adaptation models;Syntactics","","8","","31","IEEE","20 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results clearly indicate that the students selected this major on their own, based on their previous experiences in informatics, but that these experiences caused misconceptions rather than creating a true picture of the nature of computer sciences. Based on the analysis of the students' answers, we concluded that they are in great need of institutional support, especially at the beginning of their tertiary studies, to introduce them to computer sciences/informatics. Beyond this, we have revealed another misconception that Software Engineering students tend to focus on the coding aspect of informatics, and especially those who have taken the advanced level school leaving exam are over-confident as regards their programming skills.","","978-1-5386-1264-4","10.1109/CogInfoCom.2017.8268247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8268247","students of informatics;attitude;computer problem solving;computational thinking;algorithmic skills","Informatics;Problem-solving;Programming profession;Education;Task analysis;Engineering profession","","6","","28","IEEE","25 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Student participants were 11 third graders at one public elementary school in Taiwan. The project in an after-school learning program lasted for five weeks. During weekly learning session, each student needed to use one visual block programming called Ozoblockly to design action patterns for their robots (Ozobot). The study adopted a case study methodology to examine the specific learning scenario. The principal researcher used a participant observation method to observe students' learning behaviors, informal after-class interviews to collect students' learning responses, and a portfolio analysis approach to examine students' programming works. The findings showed that students might obtain a basic understanding of a computer engineer after the instructional intervention. Furthermore, some specific learning patterns from young children's programming process were identified.","","978-1-5386-7764-3","10.1109/WEEF-GEDC.2018.8629609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8629609","K–5 Engineering Education;Educational Robotics;Computational Thinking","Robots;Programming profession;Problem-solving;Training;Task analysis","","5","","15","IEEE","31 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have seen a growing interest of using Python in programming at our secondary schools during the past six years. However, the transition from using the still prevalent Pascal to Python is often only formal, regardless of the language specifics of Python. In addition, teaching programming is oriented primarily to mastering language constructions. In the frame of the National project IT Academy we have focused on inquiry-based programming teaching. In our teaching and learning materials we exploit the 5E learning cycle. Firstly, pupils are engaged in a topic, then they explore a topic and give explanation for their findings, then elaborate on their learning and finally are evaluated. Their learning is not focused just on acquiring skills and experience using suitable Python commands and data structures, but also on using various problem solving strategies. The paper presents examples of teaching materials and interesting findings and comments from pilot teachers.","2623-8764","978-953-233-099-1","10.23919/MIPRO48935.2020.9245275","European Social Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9245275","Inquiry-based education;programming;Python;computational thinking;secondary school","Education;Tools;Problem-solving;Pupils;Informatics;Programming profession;Python","","4","","19","","6 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
