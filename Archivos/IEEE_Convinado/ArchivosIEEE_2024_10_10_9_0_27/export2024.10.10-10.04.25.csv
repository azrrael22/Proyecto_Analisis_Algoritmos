Students who can link algebraic functions to their corresponding graphs perform well in STEM courses. Early algebra curricula teaches these concepts in tandem. However, it is challenging to assess whether students are linking the concepts. Video analyses, interviews and other traditional methods that aim to quantify how students link the concepts taught in school require precious classroom and teacher time. We use web logs to infer learning. Web logs are widely available and amenable to data science. Our approach partitions the web interface into components related to data and graph concepts. We collect click and mouse movement data as users interact with these components. We used statistical and data mining techniques to model their learning behavior. We built our models to assess learning behavior for a workshop presented in Summer 2016. Students in the workshop were middle-school math teachers planning to use this curriculum in their own classrooms. We used our models to assess participation levels, a prerequisite indicator for learning. Our models aligned with ground-truth traditional methods for 17 of 18 students. The results of the models with respect to the two types of components of the web portal have been used to infer possible data or graph oriented cognitive bias.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8658913","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658913","Mathematical Modeling;Computational Thinking;Data Science;web log analytics","Data models;Portals;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Data mining;Conferences","","3","","16","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We claim that mathematical concepts related to induction, inference and logical reasoning are among such knowledge. To confirm it we conducted a quasi-experiment with students who were enrolled at a first programming course (CS1). We analysed their mathematical knowledge through a test and gathered information on their difficulties and strategies used to overcome their programming difficulties. The data sample was too small to allow for strong assertions. However, the results indicates a possible correlation between mathematical abilities and programming potential. Also, students repute the logic of programming and teaching methodology as the main sources of difficulties.

Deployment of a computational physics simulation/model is extremely complex given the fact that both knowledge and skills for the science equations and the computational and programming aspects are required for a fully functional simulation, typically requiring a science educator and computer scientists/developer to work together. However, when using Easy JavaScript Simulation (EjsS) modeling toolkit, the instructor can be both the science educator and computer programmer, only needing to define the simulation variables, model and view, and the modeling toolkit can generate the computer codes for the physics simulation. Moreover, the programming aspects can become even more complex if simulations require being optimized for both Android and iOS mobile devices. The current version of EjsS provides instructors with an authoring tool that includes facilities for the creation of such JavaScript simulations as mobile apps, thus simplifying the purely programming aspects. This paper presents a new and novel EjsS functionality to generate physics simulation apps for iOS and Android. The generation process is based on the integration of the Ionic/Cordova and AngularJS technologies into EjsS.

Grammar is often taught explicitly in the course of foreign language instruction despite potential misgivings about the details of effectiveness. Different approaches rest on different conceptual and pedagogical rationales, which in turn rely on different forms of conceptual and empirical research. We seek to extend a COOL Informatics approach to grammar instruction in foreign language teaching. COOL Informatics is the acronym for Cooperative and Computer Science supported Open Learning and adopts a neurodidactic approach to teaching in general, in which processes of deduction and generalisation are supported by computational methods of storing, representing and explaining points of language usage. In addition, this represents an opportunity for cross-curricular cooperation between teaching in computer science and language. From neurodidactics we know that the learning and memorizing process in the brain can be supported by using advance organizers such as concept maps for visualizing and structuring the learning contents. With the visual language UML, the Unified Modeling Language, and other diagram types, the field of computer science offers a wide range of such advance organizers. They can be applied for quite a lot of purposes or learning and teaching situations. In this paper we focus on the benefits of computer science models for grammar instruction in foreign language classes aiming at making grammar visible, comprehensible and memorable. We present several ideas for the use of UML diagrams for describing, explaining and learning grammar rules and structures in lucid diagrams. Especially activity and class diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams seem to be very helpful as our experiences gained so far suggest. The paper describes the COOL Informatics teaching approach and it draws a connection between computer science and foreign languages. Furthermore, it shows how to use different types of UML diagrams for visualizing different aspects of grammar teaching and learning. We summarize the most important experiences and results from our last projects related to modeling and present the newest study on UML for grammar learning with some preliminary results.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274063","modeling;UML;grammar instruction;computational thinking","Grammar;Unified modeling language;Education;Computational modeling;Informatics;Computer science;Tools","","2","","28","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this first stage, we conducted a pilot study aimed at conducting a differentiated measurement of cognitive loads through secondary tasks and a subjective scale. The pilot study consisted of three moments. The first one focused on measuring their working memory capacity and their prior knowledge of statistics. Then, students worked on a learning activity focused on using Chi-square and Pearson correlation to conduct inferential analyses. The study included two different instructional designs in the form of computational notebooks. Design 1 consisted of correct and incomplete examples, while Design 2 included correct, incomplete, and incorrect examples. Simultaneously, students had to attend to a secondary task, which consisted of responding to an auditory stimulus, after which they had to press a key on their keyboard. Finally, students completed a naïve rating scale of cognitive loads involved in the task. The results highlight the important role of prior knowledge in different instructional designs and how it connects to students' perceived cognitive effort. Likewise, the differences in the instructional designs influenced students' cognitive loads, suggesting a differentiated measure of extraneous loads. Using incorrect examples in learning statistics and programming may affect students' perceived difficulty without resulting in a better learning outcome.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-6244-0","10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962606","Cognitive load;Computational Statistics;Computational Thinking;Subjective Scale;Secondary Task;Working Memory","Presses;Correlation;Keyboards;Cognitive load;Task analysis;Programming profession","","1","","14","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this has been changing thanks to the widespread idea that all children should have the opportunity to learn a little computer skills from an early age, since they will live in a world where computing is everywhere. Aware that the teaching of programming is not the future but the present, countries such as the United States, Singapore, Estonia and even Spain, face this strategic challenge, which not only prepares students for an increasingly technological labour market, it encourages the development of useful skills for any student regardless of their future professional activity. With this idea in mind, this article describes the case study carried out in a classroom of Early Childhood Education, with students of 5 years of age, with which basic programming concepts have been worked out. The results obtained indicate that they have been able to master the new vocabulary, assimilate the concepts and work for themselves with the chosen tool to carry out the intervention.","","978-1-7281-3182-5","10.1109/SIIE48397.2019.8970118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8970118","Programming;Early Childhood Education;Basic Concepts;Computational Thinking","","","1","","13","IEEE","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a nationally representative sample of U.S. teens, 99% of boys and 94% of girls played video games. Over 45% of women play video games and 30% of people over the age of 50 play games on a regular basis. Overall, 72% of Americans play video games in the U.S. and the amount of time spent playing games continues to increase, as do foreign markets. The increased market capitalization of the industry increases demand of qualified applicants. Other industries leveraging similar technology are beginning to grow and have topped over $10 billion in revenue in 2014. Students with expertise in game and related technology will have an advantage in these new job opportunities. Christian Brothers University (CBU) seeks to fill this need by the creation of a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Management (BSEM - Information Management) in Video Game Design.

We have observed, however, that there is a sizable gap between these two representations, and that many students who master the former have great difficulty translating that knowledge into the latter. We suspect that our pedagogy could be made more effective by treating diagrams themselves as formal entities, and providing students with a way of mapping operations on the ldquoeasyrdquo (pictorial) domain into the ldquohardrdquo (programmatic) domain. To help develop this technique, we carried out a semester-long experiment in which students demonstrated their understanding of the material both in diagrams and in code.

Results revealed that children prefer haptic interfaces to interact with technological devices. Congruently, the adoption of mobile phones and tablets was easier at the expense of the use of laptops. In addition, the proposed learning methodology, based on gamification principles, was determinant to promote in-class interaction and tutor-children interaction. In addition, gamification was crucial for the learning outcomes and to provide insight on programming.

The novelty of this tool and its discussion for the VL/HCC community lies in the design and customization of this tool to meet real world constraints of formal classrooms. In addition, it encourages expansion of who we consider users and requires inclusion of where and how learning takes place to truly support human-centered development of programming tools. In this paper, we shift the focus from individual users to multiple groups of student users and 1–3 teachers/mentors in a classroom environment. In particular, this paper aims to make explicit the unique needs of teachers and students who may have limited technology expertise both in coding and using Arduinos in formal classroom environments, the human and technological constraints of a formal classroom and features we've designed into CASMM to address these needs. Through this paper, we aim to spark discussion about the human-centered requirements of these users and how tools that support learners end-to-end in the development process may be necessary to truly provide accessible programming languages and environments for a wide range of novices (i.e., students, classroom teachers, and college mentors/volunteers).","1943-6106","979-8-3503-2946-9","10.1109/VL-HCC57772.2023.00030","NSF(grant numbers:1934113); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10305639","K-12 Education;physical computing;Arduino;computational thinking;design;block-based programming","Visualization;Learning management systems;Computer languages;Encoding;Sparks;Programming profession","","","","22","IEEE","7 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, we discussed the need to introduce ML to industrial design by presenting examples and ML tools with lower scientific thresholds such as Weka that is preferable for industrial design students and practitioners. A five-stage process of applying ML to product form-giving is presented to illustrate the bridging of ML to the design process.

Machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and AI in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing curricula.

Game-based environments are often used to develop these skills, but they lack sufficient voluntariness to assess aspects related to intrinsic motivation, such as interests, skills, persistence in solving a problem and behavior in response to rewards. These aspects directly affect achievement and academic performance, so it is necessary to analyze possible age and gender differences in order to adjust Computational Thinking curricula. With this aim, we deployed a voluntary video game which addresses basic computational concepts, based on intrinsic motivation, and aimed at early ages. Data were collected and analyzed using game learning analytics for 15 months, during which 4124 users played more than 28187 games. The analysis shows significant age and gender differences in relation to interests, skills, achievement, and progression through attempts. It was observed that the concepts addressed were achievable between the ages of 3 and 6 years and full mastery was possible by the age of 4 years, regardless of gender, as children persist with the challenge, intrinsically motivated, until it is overcome. In terms of persistence, significantly different behaviors were observed in the face of the challenge, which can help us to adjust the different learning methodologies to each age group and gender, adapting the way we provide reinforcement and rewards, especially for boys in the more complex challenges and for girls from the age of 5 years onwards.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3110475","Madrid Regional Government through the Project e-Madrid-CM(grant numbers:S2018/TCS-4307); European Structural and Investment Funds, namely the European Social Fund (FSE) and the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9529183","Computational thinking;early ages;game learning analytics;interests;intrinsic motivation;learn to program;persistence;rewards;skills;video games","Games;Education;Programming profession;Data mining;Problem-solving;Tools","","14","","65","CCBY","3 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One step towards achieving it is learning to analyse and create algorithms. Researchers have long been trying to establish how the form of representation of algorithms (pseudocode versus flowchart) affects its understanding and have reached varying, sometimes conflicting results. This article presents findings that provide objective new data on this topic. In our experiment, we used two different types of algorithmic tasks with three levels of complexity and a group of 114 research participants with varying programming skills. In addition, we used an eye tracking technique that allowed us to collect detailed information about the subjects’ attention distribution during analysis of algorithms. Our results show that subjects took significantly less time to analyse flowcharts (than they did with pseudocode), made much fewer errors, and had higher confidence in the correctness of their solution. Based on eye tracking data, a reduced number of both re-analyses of the algorithm and input data re-referencing was observed for graphically presented tasks. The difference in favour of flowcharts was revealed (with few exceptions) for all levels of algorithm complexity (simple, medium, complex), while regarding the duration of analysis the advantage of flowcharts increased with the growing complexity of algorithms. For complex algorithms, a significant relationship was observed between algorithm presentation and level of programming skills versus the duration of task solving and confidence level. Our study strongly supports the idea of using graphic representation of algorithms both when learning to code and in acquiring computational thinking skills.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3230981","Scientific Research Fund of the Pedagogical University of Krakow; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9994685","Coding;computational thinking;eye tracking;flowchart;pseudocode;solving algorithmic problems","Flowcharts;Codes;Gaze tracking;Task analysis;Computer languages;Education;Programming profession","","3","","40","CCBY","20 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The growing importance of “flipping the classroom” and the needful emphasizing of online-learning were owed to the situation. To meet these requirements, materials and tasks must be adapted. The Open Educational Resource (OER) textbook “Computational Thinking with the BBC micro:bit” was developed for the introduction of Computational Thinking (CT) for 10-14-year-old pupils in Austria's secondary schools. Example tasks in the textbook are designed with an open end and present extensions with ideas for further development instead of ending abruptly. This article provides a guideline for a clear distinction in redesigning existing lessons following the Inverted Classroom Model (ICM) using videos for pre-class work and live task extensions for in-class work. Which parts in the learning design must remain as live lessons and which parts can be adapted for video lessons? The respective research shows that examples that have a makerspace activity as an extension are especially helpful for an efficient determination of the appropriate part in the learning design and particularly suitable for an adaptation with ICM. The central advantage of the ICM is that it responds flexibly to the individual learning needs of each student. It allows students to take their time reviewing the material at their own pace without getting left behind. The textbook used here encourages pupils to find their own solutions by explorative learning using the block-based programming environment MakeCode. Additional information to be uncovered by the learner is provided for every single step in the accompanying online wiki website. Results from observations showed that this uncover-function, being a central element of the online material, encouraged the learners to explore their own way in finding a solution with playful elements and increased motivation. The many haptic elements of a makerspace activity are in particular useful for consolidation of the learned and are predisposed for in-class work and deepening the understanding following the constructionism theory. A Design-Based Research (DBR) approach is used to create and evaluate the redesign of a proven example task in a pilot project. Teachers, who are already familiar with the BBC micro:bit and the OER textbook, were trained on how to use the “flip-version” of an example task in their lessons and asked to develop a lesson plan for implementation. The didactic approach to redesigning the material and teacher training was evaluated during the first cycle of DBR.

In data collection, a problem involving “limit and sequence” from calculus was used to examine students' collaboration with ChatGPT. Students were asked to construct a program that produces a solution to this problem in Python, and meanwhile, it was stated that they could work in pairs with ChatGPT. The responses provided by ChatGPT to the students in the computational problem-solving were evaluated in both computational and mathematical contexts and a list of cases in which ChatGPT could and could not support students in the computational thinking practices was created. Aside from the incorrect or implicit answers provided by ChatGPT, in general, it was determined that ChatGPT supported the student's performance in computational thinking. It was deduced that it was important for the student to make a rational problem-solving plan and to guide the ChatGPT with the appropriate prompts in order to use rational questioning that leads to productive argumentation with ChatGPT.","","979-8-3503-7287-8","10.1109/EEITE61750.2024.10654434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10654434","ChatGPT;Python;programming;computational thinking","Education;Collaboration;Data collection;Chatbots;Calculus;Problem-solving;Python","","","","19","IEEE","5 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Stealth assessment analyzes a stream of fine-grained student interaction data from a game-based learning environment to dynamically draw inferences about students' competencies through evidence-centered design. In evidence-centered design, evidence models have been traditionally designed using statistical rules authored by domain experts that are encoded using Bayesian networks. This article presents DeepStealth, a deep learning-based stealth assessment framework, that yields significant reductions in the feature engineering labor that has previously been required to create stealth assessments. DeepStealth utilizes end-to-end trainable deep neural network-based evidence models. Using this framework, evidence models are devised using a set of predictive features captured from raw, low-level interaction data to infer evidence for competencies. We investigate two deep learning-based evidence models, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and n-gram encoded feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). We compare these models' predictive performance for inferring students' knowledge to linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) and naïve Bayes models. We perform feature set-level analyses of game trace logs and external pre-learning measures, and we examine the models' early prediction capacity. The framework is evaluated using data collected from 182 middle school students interacting with a game-based learning environment for middle grade computational thinking. Results indicate that LSTM-based stealth assessors outperform competitive baseline approaches with respect to predictive accuracy and early prediction capacity. We find that LSTMs, FFNNs, and CRFs all benefit from combined feature sets derived from both game trace logs and external pre-learning measures.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2019.2922356","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1138497,DRL-1640141); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8735739","Computational thinking;deep learning;educational games;game-based learning;stealth assessment.","Hidden Markov models;Computational modeling;Games;Predictive models;Task analysis;Adaptation models;Computer science","","40","","80","IEEE","12 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A profiling approach was used to test whether the impact of the CCEs could be accounted for by differences in students' motivated and self-regulated engagement. Overall, CCEs had positive impacts on students' grades and knowledge test scores, and although there were differences in achievement across the profiles, the impact of the CCEs was generally consistent across profiles.

However, crafting pedagogical HRI designs and robot interventions that have a real, positive impact on participants' learning, as well as effectively measuring such impact, is still an open challenge. As a first effort in tackling the issue, in this paper we propose a novel robot-mediated, collaborative problem solving activity for school children, called JUSThink, aiming at improving their computational thinking skills. JUSThink will serve as a baseline and reference for investigating how the robot's behaviour can influence the engagement of the children with the activity, as well as their collaboration and mutual understanding while working on it. To this end, this first iteration aims at investigating (i) participants' engagement with the activity (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory-IMI), their mutual understanding (IMIlike) and perception of the robot (Godspeed Questionnaire); (ii) participants' performance during the activity, using several performance and learning metrics. We carried out an extensive user-study in two international schools in Switzerland, in which around 100 children participated in pairs in one-hour long interactions with the activity. Surprisingly, we observe that while a teams' performance significantly affects how team members evaluate their competence, mutual understanding and task engagement, it does not affect their perception of the robot and its helpfulness, a fact which highlights the need for baseline studies and multi-dimensional evaluation metrics when assessing the impact of robots in educational activities.","1944-9437","978-1-7281-6075-7","10.1109/RO-MAN47096.2020.9223343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223343","educational robotics;collaborative problem solving;computational thinking;engagement;mutual modelling;robot perception;human-robot interaction","Conferences;Humanoid robots;Collaboration;Particle measurements;Collaborative work;Task analysis;Robots","","10","","27","IEEE","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the nation's continuing shortage of scientists and engineers, there is an urgent need for diverse students, especially Hispanic students, to enter and complete science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education at all levels. Contributing factors to the low representation in STEM areas are the lack of Hispanic youth's exposure to engaging and relevant experiences with science in their early stages of development and the lack of Latino scientists as role models that are visible, tangible, real, and inspiring to their communities. In addition, student experiences in math and science in the middle grades have emerged as a “filter” that prevents many students from pursuing advanced STEM courses in high school and, therefore, limits their knowledge of and interest in exploring STEM subjects and careers later in their education. This paper presents a research-based approach to attract middle school students to STEM fields in a majority Hispanic region, using a game-based learning platform. The platform integrates computational thinking in the area of water conservation at middle-school level by using simulations and data visualization in concurrent learning modules.

The workshops were designed by adopting the Stanford Design Thinking Method for Kids (http://www.ideaco.org) and digital technologies with the goal to “teach” children computational thinking, collaborating in teams, resolving conflicts, presenting, giving/receiving feedback, etc. In this paper, we take a participatory action research (PAR) approach with the goal of exposing significant chunks of the incredibly rich experience. A content analysis of a qualitative survey among teachers and findings from a focus group reflect the teachers' view. The study indicates that the acquisition of digital competences needs to be backed by personal and social capacities that take time to mature.

"Data-structure validator: An application of the HY-DE model","M. Csernoch; E. Dani","Faculty of Informatics, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary; Faculty of Informatics, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary",2017 8th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Infocommunications (CogInfoCom),"25 Jan 2018","2017","","","000197","000202","In knowledge-based societies new generations are flooded more and more intensely with narratives of inherited and newly generated knowledge, which is simply accessible for these generations, or to be acquired by them. Informatics and computer sciences are continuously developing new information-storage devices and a multitude of software more rapidly than ever. However, effective information search and processing require an information literacy which the new generations characteristically, and more and more demonstrably, do not have. National and international empirical research proves that the algorithmic thinking of the younger generations, which is indispensable for the world of informatics, is underdeveloped when it comes to the effective and productive use of digital tools. Moreover, the phenomenon of hyper attention invades the everyday life and the learning habits of the younger generation to a greater and greater degree. The essence of the HY-DE model is to aid the students' learning process with the help of the teacher's purposeful control of the phases of attention (hyper, mixed and deep attention). One aim of the present study is to introduce a new application of the HY-DE model, entitled Data-Structure Validator HY-DE model (DaSVa HY-DE). In the introductory phase, the DaSVa model focuses on how the HY-DE attention-divisions manifest themselves in webpage-search as well as in the information retrieval that it yields, and what the roles of the hyper, mixed, and deep attention modes are in the development of computational thinking and algorithmic skills. In the full hyper attention status the search for specified contents is carried out, focusing on webpages which consist of data organized in table or table-like structures. The automated and semi-automated conversion of the webpages however requires the decreasing of hyper attention leading to deep or mixed attention. The final result of this conversion process is/are well-structured table(s) suitable for automated data retrieval in spreadsheets, database management, and programming. The application of the original HY-DE model would lead us to its modification. In the advanced phase of the DaSVa HY-DE model the students can also experience how the webpages are designed and structured, how they support information and data retrieval, how successful the algorithmic based retrieval can be, and how the approach would lead students to the application of the theory of well-structured webpage design. With this model, from the hyper attention data collection status, through a deep and/or mixed attention algorithm building and data analyzing process, students would reach a higher-level hyper attention, the developer status.","","978-1-5386-1264-4","10.1109/CogInfoCom.2017.8268242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8268242","information literacy;computational thinking;hyper and deep attention;data structure;webpage conversion","Tools;Computational modeling;Education;Informatics;Data structures;Media;Software","","5","","18","IEEE","25 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While Scratch has been found to increase students' motivation and interest in programming, it has been debated whether Scratch users practice and learn about core programming concepts such as loops, conditional expressions, procedures and variables. This paper presents a large scale study of the progression of the programming concepts practiced by Scratch users through an analysis of their complete public project portfolios. A dataset of over 112 thousand authors and their 1 million projects was constructed and analyzed from three viewpoints. First, we investigate the development of programming concepts by looking at block usage statistics for each project in the users' repositories. Second, we score and analyze the dataset using a computational thinking rubric. Third, we identify users that have left the Scratch platform and evaluate the learning goals they have achieved. Our results show that, while users progress in Scratch, there is a positive trend in the use of all concepts that were examined. Within the least utilized concepts, even after the 20th project of Scratch users, are procedures, conditional loops and logic operations. Examining the users who have left the Scratch platform after creating at least the mean amount of nine projects, we measured that half had left without ever utilizing procedures, and a third had left without ever utilizing conditional loops.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-8478-4","10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453973","Programming education;Scratch;Game development;Computational Thinking;K-12","Conferences;Games;Programming;Market research;Software;Trajectory;Engineering education","","4","","27","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The field of computer science education is always being challenged with the high attrition rates despite the ever growing industry demand for computing expertise. The lower rate of student retention is often associated with considerable dropout and failure rates in introductory programming courses during the freshmen year. The main challenge is getting students to write meaningful programs in a short time by focusing more on computational thinking principles and less on language details at that point in time. Nowadays, most students prefer to be engaged and discover course content through exploration, interaction, and collaboration that is relevant, useful, and fun compared to traditional blackboard-based lecturing styles. For evaluation of learning outcomes based on the quantifiable criteria with robust statistical analysis, eleven sections of the course over three semesters were considered.

One important aspect in this scenario is data generation, which have to be carefully tackled by government's and who develop solutions to SHC. In this way, using IoT for teaching CT is an important aspect, also considering open data, privacy and SHC context. In our pedagogical practice, students were able to design and develop solutions to problems in their daily lives indirectly applying CT skills, such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, automation and analysis, as well as self-skills, collaboration, creativity and critically, required nowadays in broad professional training. It was also possible to develop students' interest in raising awareness of the use of computational technologies, as a solution to problems in society considering aspects of SHC and open data; propose a technological solution using IoT; and analyze the use of these data collected for the social well-being.

The crucial aim is to develop the so-called computational thinking which is going to be more and more essential for a successful personal and professional development of every individual. There is a broad range of factors influencing the success of the change in the curriculum, which is, inter alia, supposed to include coding. In addition to the necessary teaching aids and know-how, teachers also need to have positive attitudes towards its implementation. The main objective of our research is to identify teachers' attitudes towards introducing coding to their classes. We discovered that not all teachers of computing agree with including algorithmization and coding in their teaching. Approximately one half of the questioned educators hold a negative attitude towards the curricular change; they would rather continue teaching computer user skills and basic programs. Their attitude proves to be an impediment to a successful curricular change as teachers should fully grasp the teaching content and communicate it with enthusiasm to their pupils. Insufficient knowledge is the key factor influencing teachers' negative attitudes towards the introduction of coding to schools.","","978-1-7281-3180-1","10.1109/Informatics47936.2019.9119333","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9119333","coding;school;teacher;computational thinking;pupil","","","3","","12","IEEE","17 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, adopting robotic learning with CT and AT can enhance learning skills over the conventional learning model. This paper presents a systematic literature review on CT and AT practices in robotics learning to improve educational methods. This study conducts a systematic literature review from four databases: ACM, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect. Sixty-five studies in robotics learning to increase CT and AT skills were analyzed by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study’s findings show that CT and AT are significant in training students to engage in robotics learning activities. These considerations will lead to strengthening their skill and critical thinking. The study also suggests that integrating these skills can prepare teachers for critical thinking and boost student learning. The findings suggest that CT and AT can directly adopt digital adversarial learning skills to improve overall robotics learning activities. For future studies, the difference in learning ages related to robotics activities with CT and AT applications can be studied to deeply comprehend the effectiveness of CT and AT applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3249761","Ministry of Higher Education via a Research Grant Award(grant numbers:FRGS/1/2019/ICT02/UKM/02/9); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10054368","Robotics;computational thinking;adversarial thinking;experiential learning model","Robots;Computational modeling;Systematics;Education;Mathematical models;Learning systems;Adaptation models;Fourth Industrial Revolution","","3","","131","CCBYNCND","27 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Additionally, the study proposed to identify the relevant features of the camp's design and implementation that can promote practitioners' engagement and address the challenges they face. The course was offered during the summer semester of 2023. For the procedure of the study, pre-service teachers thought about a problem or situation using the phenomena-based learning method and explained the problem using mediating tools, including educational robots, 3D printers, laser-cutting, and creative Lego boxes, among others. At the end of the course, students developed their project, designed a prototype of a robotic-coding camp, and created digital stories as real-world basis problem statements for their project. Students' assignments and group work interactions, including forum discussions in Moodle, reflection papers, and hands-on activities, were used as data sources. Data collected and analyzed by qualitatively. Participatory action research was used as a research method. The results provide guidelines for how to design and implement robotic coding camps and digital stories for teachers who might want to implement a robotic camp in their future careers. In addition, the results suggest improvement strategies for designing robotic coding activities, including four action steps: (1) phenomenon-based problem statement, (2) visualizing the problem as a digital story, (3) finding a pattern in the problem and (4) creating the learning environment and coding.

The recent introduction of programming education has created an additional task for educators to learn about programming in order to teach it. Programming education was introduced in April 2020, and little research has been done to measure the knowledge gap of educators. In March 2020, a month before the implementation of programming instruction in Japanese schools, 22 elementary schools were visited to access readiness and to distribute an online survey. The surveys and informal interviews revealed the unpreparedness of educators for the task of teaching programming and limited programming material in the approved textbooks.

Despite the potential of predictive modelling in providing timely adaptive learning and gameplay experience, there is a lack of research on the early prediction of learners’ performance in educational games. In this research, we propose an early predictive modelling approach, called GameEPM, to estimate learners’ final scores in an educational game for promoting computational thinking. Specifically, the GameEPM approach models the sequence of learners’ actions and then uses a limited sequence of the actions to predict the final score of the game for each learner. The findings from our initial trials show that our approach can accurately and robustly estimate the learners’ performance at the early stages of the game. Using less than 50% of learners’ action sequences, the cross-validated deep learning model achieves a squared correlation higher than 0.8 with a relative error of less than 8%, outperforming a range of regression models like linear regression, random forest, neural networks, and support vector machines. An additional experiment showed that the validated deep learning model can also achieve high performance while tested on an independent game dataset, showing its applicability and robustness in real-world cases. Comparing the results with traditional machine learning methods revealed that, in the validation and application phases, up to 0.30 and 0.35 R2 gain is achieved in favor of the deep learning model, respectively.

The difficulties vary from subject to subject. Teachers' first challenge in Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking teaching is their technological literacy and competency challenges. Lack of confidence, time, and willingness are significant reasons for the challenge. One of the studies on mathematics teaching shows that teachers need more knowledge tools and models to facilitate the analysis during the teaching process. Researchers assert that educational practice has focused more on technology than on new pedagogies needed to truly use technology in a transformative way. Frameworks are designed to meet high-level objectives set by the authorities. Teachers are provided with teaching materials for developing the course contents. The frameworks act as a connection between high-level objectives and low-level teaching materials. In this paper, we present the elaboration of a framework for teaching CS at the early stages of education. The framework consists of three components based on modelling real-world problems into a machine-world context and then realising the machine solution in the real world. Moreover, the problem-solving component of the framework emphasizes the iterative process of learning that strengthens the previous concepts and provides a logical con-nection between the previous and new concepts. The framework was evaluated in the context of Saudi Arabia, where the teachers were interviewed individually and then provided with a guide for teaching grade-4 learners. The guide was developed using the material provided by the Saudi Ministry of Education. The teachers taught using this guide over a sequence of lessons. At the end of this time, a second individual teacher interview was conducted to determine teacher experience. The results show that teaching using the framework is effective, and it is not only easier for teachers to understand the teaching method but also for learners to learn the content quickly.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342646","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342646","K-12;Computer Science Education;Computational Thinking","Computer science;Surveys;Computational modeling;Education;Mathematical models;Problem-solving;Iterative methods","","","","39","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The fundamental concept behind Bayes’ theorem revolves around comprehending the degree of truth within the confines of an explicit perspective. This involves partitioning the entire sample space of possible evidence and utilizing the subset containing the relevant perspective to estimate the uncertainty of an event or the reliability of a model. However, it is often found difficult for students to understand Bayes’ theorem to the level of applying it to real-world problems.

Research indicates that students, irrespective of their educational level, face difficulties in grasping fundamental concepts in mechanics of materials. These challenges arise from the inherent complexity of concepts like stress, strain, torsion, and buckling, which are difficult to observe, hindering comprehension. Therefore, this work aims to leverage the synergy between mechanics of materials and computational principles to actively engage students in advanced topics such as structural strength, failure of structures, and sensitivity analysis, through the use of computational notebooks. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we first asked students to analyze truss structures using hand calculations following the discrete stiffness method within a Finite Element Analysis framework. Subsequently, we implemented the same method as a simulation tool in a MATLAB Computational Notebook. Finally, we asked the students to reflect on: (1) the value of using computational methods to approach Finite Element Analysis when compared to hand calculations; (2) the difficulties they faced when implementing the activities in the MATLAB Computational Notebook; (3) the support they required to successfully complete these activities; and (4) the effectiveness of the simulation tool in understanding the effect of forces and stress distributions in structures. We anticipate that computational notebooks will provide an ideal platform for sharing lessons and tutorials, enhancing student engagement, and promoting active learning.

Python was selected to conduct the analysis because of its popularity and utility in the broader engineering field. Early exposure to this highly desired engineering skill can provide added benefits to students. Combining Python with an engaging lab experience can have a compounding effect on student learning outcomes. A five-week Python-based lab module was developed for an introductory thermal-fluid science class. The module reinforced fundamental concepts learned in lecture, while expanding on design-related analysis which is often left for advanced courses. The lab module began with an introduction to Python programming and quickly transitioned to the parametric analysis of standard Rankine, Gas Turbine, and Vapor Compression cycles. The lab module was designed to be self-guided with step-by-step instructions presented using Google Colab. This paper details the implementation and the student outcomes. Both direct and indirect assessments were conducted over two semesters of the course. Results indicate a strong positive impact on Python programming learning outcomes. Students acquired a working knowledge of Python programming and experienced how computational tools can be used to solve advanced engineering problems. At the same time, the student feedback indicated students' resistance to open-ended projects and independent learning; even if they are aware of their relevance and benefits to their future careers.
