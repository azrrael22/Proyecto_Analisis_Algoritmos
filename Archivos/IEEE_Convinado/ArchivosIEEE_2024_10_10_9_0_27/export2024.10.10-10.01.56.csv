Currently, there is a strong push to integrate aspects of programming and coding into the classroom environment. However, few if any tools exist that enable real-time formative assessment of in-class programming tasks. The proposed REACT (Real Time Evaluation and Assessment of Computational Thinking) system is a first step toward allowing teachers to see which high-level concepts students have mastered and which ones they are struggling with as students code in real time. REACT supports and facilitates the teaching of 21st century computing skills such as computational thinking [1] in the classroom environment.","1943-6106","978-1-4799-4035-6","10.1109/VLHCC.2014.6883021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883021","Computational Thinking;Online Assessment;Real Time Assessment;Computational Thinking Pattern;Computational Thinking Pattern Analysis","Real-time systems;Games;Programming profession;Pattern analysis;Educational institutions;Computer science education","","28","","16","IEEE","28 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The evaluation tool makes an evaluation for Machine Learning Model and each of the Computational Thinking seven fields. Via this developed tool, the objective is to product an alternative to the limited evaluation tools on Block-Based Programming Languages. Literature research was brought out in two sides as Machine Learning and Block-Based Programming Languages. In the first stage, on Machine Learning, the data set and the methods used in educational field were researched. In the second stage, the devices which are used to measure the performance on Block- Based Programming Languages were analyzed. On literature, there are various sources for teaching Computational Thinking ,but it occurs that measuring instruments that evaluates Computational Thinking are inadequate. To evaluate Computational Thinking a machine learning model was trained. Trained model was turned into online evaluation tool by which both the tutors and the students evaluate Computational Thinking easily. In the final stage, the developed online evaluation tool and the outcome was analyzed.","","978-1-7281-8541-5","10.1109/UYMS50627.2020.9247066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9247066","Machine Learning;Block-Based Programming Languages;Computational Thinking","Performance evaluation;Computer languages;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Tools;Programming profession;Software engineering","","","","19","IEEE","9 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computational thinking, closely related to programming, requires thinking and solving problems with different levels of abstraction and is independent of hardware devices. The early childhood education stage provides teachers with the opportunity to lay the foundations for a comprehensive quality education using innovative tools and technologies. Educational robotics in early childhood education becomes a tool that facilitates the acquisition of knowledge to children, playfully, based on the principles of interactivity, social interrelationships, collaborative work, creativity, constructivist and constructionist learning, and a student-centered didactic approach, allowing in turn that student can acquire digital competencies and develop logical and computational thinking in an underlying way. This project explores the current state of teaching and learning computational thinking and programming in early childhood education in an inclusive manner. Moreover, the lack of diversity and inequality is particularly latent in science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields.

In response to the growing computational intensity of the healthcare industry, biomedical engineering (BME) undergraduate education is starting to emphasize computation and computational thinking. Computational thinking is a way of thinking that uses concepts and methodologies of computing to solve problems in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary subjects. In broader terms, computational thinking is not only associated with using computational tools but also with the thought process of solving a problem by data representation, problem decomposition, and algorithm design. Despite being so important, there is little research work or information available on the development of computational thinking in BME undergraduate students. Our research focuses on how BME undergraduate students develop computational thinking skills while performing group activities related to problem-solving. In order to conduct this study, we incorporate a teaching methodology that prompts computational thinking in a thermodynamics course being taught at a public mid-western university to approximately 120 sophomore students. We observe classroom activities involving analytical problem solving followed by pseudo code generation for computational coding. In order to investigate computational thinking, we collect classroom observations of small groups of students as they come up with a solution to an analytical problem with each other. We complement the observation notes of the classroom activities with follow up semi structured interviews with individual students from five groups. Thematic analysis of the student interviews is used in order to analyze student responses towards the incorporation of computation intensive teaching methodology.

This mindset channels number-crunching toward an ambition to discover knowledge through logic, models and simulations. Here we show how computational cognitive science can be used to reconstruct and analyse the structure of computational thinking mindsets (forma mentis in Latin) through complex networks. As a case study, we investigate cognitive networks tied to key concepts of computational thinking provided by (i) 159 high school students enrolled in a science curriculum and (ii) 59 researchers in complex systems and simulations. Researchers' reconstructed knowledge highlighted a positive mindset about scientific modelling, semantically framing data and simulations as ways of discovering nature. Students correctly identified different aspects of logic reasoning but perceived ‘computation’ as a distressing, anxiety-eliciting task, framed with math jargon and lacking links to real-world discovery. Students' mindsets around ‘data’, ‘model’ and ‘simulations’ critically revealed no awareness of numerical modelling as a way for understanding the world. Our findings provide evidence of a crippled computational thinking mindset in students, who acquire mathematical skills that are not channelled toward real-world discovery through coding. This unlinked knowledge ends up being perceived as distressing number-crunching expertise with no relevant outcome. The virtuous mindset of researchers reported here indicates that computational thinking can be restored by training students specifically in coding, modelling and simulations in relation to discovering nature. Our approach opens innovative ways for quantifying computational thinking and enhancing its development through mindset reconstruction.","2051-1329","","10.1093/comnet/cnab020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684795","computational thinking;cognitive network science;mindset reconstruction;education","","","","","","","18 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This study provides evidence of the effectiveness of teaching C++ (a low-level programming language) to develop computational thinking in high school students in Chile. By applying a test before and after a voluntary C++ workshop, the results reveal a significant improvement in computational thinking after the workshop. However, we observe that there was a tendency to drop out of the workshop among students with lower levels of initial computational thinking. Besides, tenth-grade students obtained lower final scores than eleventh and twelfth-grade students. These results indicate that teaching a low-level programming language is useful, but it has high entry-barriers.","1522-4902","978-1-5386-9233-2","10.1109/SCCC.2018.8705239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8705239","Computational Thinking Test;C++;Programming in High School","C++ languages;Visualization;Media;Education;Conferences;Silicon compounds","","3","","30","IEEE","6 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, this study investigated the students' performance in a Computational Thinking course offered at the freshman level to predict student academic success. To achieve this goal, a two-year study of the correlation between the students' accumulative grade point averages and their grades obtained in this course was conducted. The performance of nine hundred and eighty two students in forty sections was assessed over the two-year period. It was concluded that the students' future academic performance is strongly correlated to their Computational Thinking skills assessed at the freshman level. This clearly suggests the viability of using Computational Thinking skills as a fairly accurate predictor of students' academic success.

Conversely, for the students of the Department of Information Management, learning computational thinking before programming did not result in better learning outcomes, emphasizing the need for coherence in courses. The students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering showed the practical value of computational thinking in non-IT disciplines, particularly in using specialized software such as MATLAB. For students with foundational knowledge, the learning sequence between learning computational thinking and programming was less significant. However, for beginners or those from non-IT backgrounds, effective learning required the coherence and integration of courses. Thus, it is required to maintain cross-course coherence and establish links between computational thinking and programming skills to offer a more in-depth learning experience.","","979-8-3503-2778-6","10.1109/SSIM59263.2023.10469197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10469197","computational thinking;programming;learning sequence;course coherence;interdisciplinary application","Training;Systematics;Social sciences;Coherence;Programming;Software;Information management","","","","11","IEEE","22 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To be innovative it is necessary that a person use sophisticated cognitive structures to reason over abstractions and deal with hypothesis. These are the characteristics of the formal operational thinking [2]. Therefore, this paper is about the use of formal thinking on computational thinking activities over a digital fabrication project developed in a Brazilian makerspace (POALab FabLab). Using a Case Study we want to show that computational thinking and digital fabrication projects demand the use of formal thinking and, since that, the importance of designing learning activities for makerspaces taking in mind the possibilities of cognitive development.","","978-1-5090-5920-1","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190654","formal thinking;computational thinking;making;Jean Piaget","Fabrication;Tools;Games;Computational modeling;Complexity theory;Creativity;Floors","","4","","17","IEEE","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Teaching students in non-computer science majors computing thinking is challenging because students do not have experts' mental models. This study investigates the knowledge gap that non-computing major college students (n=126) possess about computational thinking in an introductory MS Excel course by measuring their performance using spreadsheet functions in three categories: recall, application, and problem solving. The empirical result, analyzed using ANOVA, shows that students can recall the meaning of those functions but seem to have trouble using them correctly and precisely (cued or uncued). Students' test results suggest the following issues: (1) problems with understanding the data type, (2) failure in translating problems to productive representations using spreadsheet functions, and (3) inadequate stipulation of the computational representations in precise forms. Addressing these problems early and explicitly in future classes could improve the education of computational thinking and alleviate difficulties students may experience in using computational thinking in learning and problem solving.","2377-634X","978-1-61284-469-5","10.1109/FIE.2011.6142980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6142980","Computational Thinking;Computer Science Education;Spreadsheet Functions;Problem Solving","Problem-solving;Computer science;Computers;Conferences;Educational institutions;Instruments","","9","","9","IEEE","2 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A quasi-experimental methodological design was used, since it did not work with a control group. A mixed exploratory investigation was carried out. 85 first-year students from the Accounting Professional School of the National University of San Agustin de Arequipa participated in the experience. The results show that in introductory programming courses of short time period, teaching with block-based programming environments compared to the use of pseudocode with the PSelnt tool, facilitates the appropriation of computational concepts and the development of computational thinking skills; thus obtaining better learning results.

The Delphi technique was employed to collect different views and derive consensus from a panel of thirteen experts, including computer scientists, computer science educators, K-12 computer teachers, and industry experts. The first draft of Delphi survey questionnaire, consisting of nine themes (problem solving, problem decomposition, algorithms, data representation, data analysis, modeling and simulation, abstraction, automation, and others) and 60 competence indicators, was developed based on our investigation of the nature of computational thinking. After three rounds of survey and a final round-table discussion, the expert panel derived 49 essential competence indicators (13 for grades K to 6, nine for grades 7 to 9 and 27 of grades 10 to 12) and eight optional competence indicators (one for grades 7 to 9 and seven for grades 10 to 12). According to the results, the core ability and training of computational thinking are different in grades. In grades K to 6, students develop logical thinking and problem solving skills in personal and family life. In grades 7 to 9, students must understand the basic concepts of programming and write basic programs. Finally, in grades 10 to 12, they will use high-level skills to apply the concepts of abstraction, modeling, and structured problem decomposition to solve problems in different fields. The results serve as useful references for developing Taiwan's new K-12 computing curriculum.","","978-1-4799-9967-5","10.1109/LaTiCE.2015.44","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7126261","Computing Curriculum;K-12 education;Computational Thinking;Delphi Survey","Computational modeling;Analytical models;Data models;Computers;Education;Computer science;Standards","","11","","4","IEEE","18 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is generally accepted that Programming is a complex task that requires a long learning process. Theoretical knowledge about fundamentals on algorithms and data structures, as well as, on programming languages are required but are not enough; practicing a lot is also necessary. However, teaching Computer Programming is a hard job, most of the times unsuccessful. To overcome all the difficulties, felt by teachers and students, an increasingly bigger community of researchers in Computer Science is defending the importance of teaching Computational Thinking to young students to train them, since very earlier, in logic and abstract reasoning for problem solving. Our starting point to approach this topic relies on the use of an Ontology (OntoCnE) that describes in detail the concepts “Computational Thinking” and “Programming”, and maps those concepts to different education levels, starting with the first year. We believe that a person just acquires a new way of thinking, or a new way of behaving, if he is trained with the appropriate learning resources. So a main investment to educate people in Computational Thinking is on the choice/creation of those convenient resources. In particular we intended to investigate the impact of Augmented Reality in the usefulness of the referred resources. In that direction we will also discuss the development of a Web Platform to help on collecting and classifying (according to the referred ontology) learning resources to be used by teachers in computing classes. On the other hand, the platform will help on the retrieval, from that repository, of the most adequate resources to teach a specific subject to a specific level.","","978-1-7281-3182-5","10.1109/SIIE48397.2019.8970131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8970131","computational thinking;programming;learning resource;teacher support tools;ontology","","","6","","15","IEEE","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these environments lack specific support for teaching computational thinking to novices. Typically, such skills are acquired in ad hoc practical sessions with supervision provided by teachers or peers. The usual scenario is where a teacher guides the students in solving these problems during a game design session. In informal learning settings, step-by-step tutorials for creating existing games are used to compensate for the lack of computer support for solving design and computational problems. In this paper we suggest a game design process that combines support for computational thinking with tool usage, by identifying the most common computational thinking problems and providing a generic solution to them. We have evaluated our solution in the context of AgentWeb, an online cloud-based game design environment for novices. We discuss how to incorporate suggested computational thinking solutions as computer assistant into the game design user interface.","2161-377X","978-1-4673-1642-2","10.1109/ICALT.2012.24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6268116","end-user programming;computational thinking;design thinking;game design environments;informal learning;cognitive walkthrough;cloud-based environments","Games;Programming;Educational institutions;Computers;Context;Tutorials","","5","","15","IEEE","16 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CT is an essential problem-solving skill set in this modern era of digitization and technological advancements. To build students' knowledge and skills in CT while maximizing students' motivation and engagement in learning, a novel online adaptive gamified course called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ) was introduced. The CTQ was designed and developed by a multidisciplinary team of students and faculty members. The key features of CTQ are (1) an interactive storyline with animated avatars, mini-games, and questions created using Unity three-dimensional cross-platform game engine and Blockly block-based visual programming language; (2) questions at three different levels of difficulty for effective adaptive and self-learning approach; (3) an answer and feedback to each question for increased students' confidence and enthusiasm towards learning; (4) hyperlinks to online learning resources for further reading; (5) a badge and a leaderboard to motivate active participation and encourage success; and (6) a course management system with automatic data saving capability to enable learning at own pace, anytime, anywhere. The CTQ was rolled out to some newly matriculated first-year undergraduate Engineering (ENG) and InfoComm Technology (ICT) students. A total of 54 ENG and 53 ICT students' learning performance and feedback were collated and analyzed. Statistical results from the paired Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test consistently reveal that (1) the median of post-test marks is significantly higher than that of pre-test marks (p < 0.001); (2) the median of CT knowledge scores after taking CTQ is significantly higher than that of before CTQ (p < 0.001); and (3) the median time taken to complete the post-test is significantly lower than the pre-test (p < 0.001). Furthermore, more than 75% of ENG and ICT students, separately, stated that CTQ is an engaging or very engaging learning platform; 81% of them indicated that the educational content of CTQ is enriching or very enriching; and 83% of them commented that CTQ has motivated independent learning. The CTQ can also serve as a bridging course to narrow the heterogeneity gap among students with heterogeneous prior knowledge on computer programming languages and ease students into programming-related modules, thereby enhancing teaching and learning effectiveness.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637467","computational thinking;gamification;adaptive learning;independent learning;online education platform","Computer languages;Visualization;Electronic learning;Conferences;Education;Games;Problem-solving","","7","","34","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the growing momentum in integrating CT into K-12 education, a higher need can be seen in developing proper assessment tools to measure what students have learned about CT. Although numerous attempts have been made to design CT assessment tools, there is a scarcity of well-validated tests for summative assessment aimed at lower primary students. To bridge this gap, we designed the Computational Thinking Test for Lower Primacy (CTt-LP), targeting students aged 6–8. This study presents the test design, content validation, and pilot testing. For test design, Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) was applied, and four constructs were selected. A total of 30 items were designed, after which content validation was performed via expert judgement and cognitive interviews with students. Revisions were made based on the validation results. The pilot testing was conducted in a public primary school in northern China, with 72 participants from Grade 2. Results indicate that the test is balanced regarding the difficulty level for the target group. Item analysis was conducted for each item, based on which decisions about the refinement of the test were made.

It is widely agreed that in order to benefit and thrive in a digital world, more than digital literacy is required. Computational thinking promises understanding of information technology and its utilization without necessarily knowing how to write code. According to many authors, skills in computational thinking include the ability to evaluate and design solutions to problems. However, the vision for computational thinking, laid out by a number of scholars, is even bigger than this. It proposes that thinking habits from computer science are beneficial for any kind of problem solving and that those thinking habits form a central part of modern sciences. It might be that components of computational thinking are indeed useful in problem solving and that they play an important part in other sciences. However, computer science combines three types of thinking traditions: theoretical (mathematical) tradition, engineering tradition and scientific tradition, and it is important to differentiate between what is an aspect in one or more of these traditions and what is unique for computer science. This clarification will support the application and teaching of computational thinking. This paper explores the uniqueness of computational thinking and its roots in theoretical, engineering and scientific traditions of computing.","2623-8764","978-953-233-098-4","10.23919/MIPRO.2019.8756712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8756712","Computational thinking;Computer science education;CSER;Computational ideas;History of computational thinking;Disciplinary ways of thinking and practicing","","","2","","35","","11 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these flaws, integrating knowledge across disciplines becomes significantly necessary. In the past years, STEM has been accepted as one of the effective strategies to bridge the difference in nature of each field to construct more practical projects and innovations. Moreover, the educational robot can be employed as a learning tool in that strategy since it not only provides challenging learning missions but also promotes computational thinking for the students. Therefore, this research study proposed STEM learning activities on three-day workshop to lay out the foundation to the high-school science-and-technology students who are becoming the engineering students. The workshop comprises of eight phases to facilitate their learning inquiry process with hands-on experience; moreover, the activities were designed in consideration of promoting computational thinking with challenging learning missions. The findings of this study showed that the proposed workshop activities are beneficial for the students who outperformed on robotics with higher computational thinking; meanwhile, they could provide more relevant responses regarding the proposed learning activities.","","978-1-5386-7447-5","10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2018.00047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8693259","STEM;computational thinking;educational robot;engineering education","Conferences;STEM;Programming profession;Robot sensing systems","","10","","17","IEEE","18 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
