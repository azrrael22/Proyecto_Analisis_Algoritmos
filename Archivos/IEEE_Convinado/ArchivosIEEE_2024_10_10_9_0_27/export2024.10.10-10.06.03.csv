To address these problems, the use of virtual reality (VR) has been explored as an innovative and potentially effective educational tool. However, so far, the effectiveness of VR applications and the perception of their use lack a clear and effective approach to be used to support education. The importance of addressing this problem lies in the need to improve the quality of teaching using emerging technologies. It is for this reason that it is important to find new strategies to improve the effectiveness of teaching using VR. In this context, this research presents the results of the FreeDev application, previously validated with 20 teachers and with 80 engineering students from a private university. FreeDev is a VR application designed to support the teaching of basic programming, it is aimed as an educational tool to provide an immersive experience to students on how to get started in programming and computational thinking. FreeDev has been well accepted, and both teachers and engineering students see it as a tool that can be used to support education. It is hoped that this research will contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field of education.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3416673","Universidad de Las Américas(grant numbers:TIC.LCC.23.01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10562294","Virtual reality;active learning;VR application;VR developer;authentic learning;active learning","Education;Usability;Training data;Programming profession;Games;Visualization;Video games;Learning systems;Authentication","","","","71","CCBYNCND","19 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In 2012, the Brazilian higher education system changed with an affirmative-action policy to admit more students from the public K-12 system: the “Quota” Law was implemented at all federal public universities. This paper aims to answer two research questions: 1) What knowledge about the positive/negative impact of certain features on the success of a CS1 course can be discovered from mining educational data augmented by social-economic information? 2) Are these features different between quota and non-quota students? The analysis uses social-economic and academic performance data of undergraduate students from 2012 to 2019. Data mining algorithms such as generalized linear model, gradient boosting machine, and random forest were applied to the data. The findings include: (1) the relevance of indicators such as the consumption rate of university-subsidized meals, (2) that gender is not a determining factor in failure/success, and (3) a higher failure rate for quota students in the Computer Engineering and Mechatronics Engineering majors.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-6244-0","10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962408","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962408","Educational Data Mining;CS1;Introduction to Computer Science course;Machine Learning","Computer languages;Mechatronics;Databases;Computational modeling;Education;Data models;Trajectory","","","","49","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, effectively defending against such attacks necessitates skilled cybersecurity professionals. Traditional human-based cyber-physical education is resource intensive and faces challenges in keeping pace with rapidly evolving technologies. This research focuses on the main advantages of incorporating large language models into cyber-physical education. The ChatGPT platform serves as an online tool to educate students on fundamentals, cyberattacks, and defense concepts, fostering the development of a new generation cybersecurity experts. The proposed learning approach adheres to the ChatGPT-assisted learn–apply–create model. Responding to prompts provided by the learners, the learning phase engages in conceptual learning, the applying phase involves mathematical modeling of various cyberattacks, and the creating phase develops MATLAB program to incorporate attacks into sensor measurements for the experiment and entails developing the necessary attack detection approaches. The effectiveness of the detection method developed by ChatGPT is assessed in both the simulation and real-time scenarios using a J-type thermocouple. The impact of the proposed learning platform over traditional learning methods is evaluated through an extensive comparative feedback analysis on the learner's foundational concepts, computational thinking, programming efficacy, and motivation. The study proved that integrating ChatGPT into engineering education enables students to swiftly learn cyber-physical fundamentals, comprehend and model cyberattacks, create new attack signatures, and contribute to developing detection algorithms. Such integration provides the learners with essential industrial skills crucial in modern industries.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2024.3417252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10568376","ChatGPT;cyberattack;cyber-physical education;Industry 4.0 skill;large language models (LLMs)","Cyberattack;Computer security;Cloud computing;Training;Security;Mathematical models;Task analysis","","","","38","IEEE","21 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, novice teachers are currently facing critical challenges when delivering subject knowledge that relates to algorithms, programming and the development of computational thinking skills without the benefit of others' experience. After a study of the relevant literature, it could be seen that far too little attention has been paid to the capturing and sharing of TPs which are not easily expressed or communicated in visual or verbal terms. Thus, we design and then demonstrate a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the capturing of TPs.

The current education system is in transition, taking slow steps in new ways of learning. By promoting self-reflection and critical thinking, students can develop problem-solving skills and observe an application of the tools learned. A proposed methodology includes new structuring of the discipline ""Algorithms and Data Structures I"" at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG), with the learning of a modern programming language and the transformation of the classic classroom model to new methods and dynamics. Computational thinking is fundamental at the beginning of the course. From this, all students receive a introduction course at the beginning of the college year to immerse in dynamics to practice logic. Classes began, students received an extension to the basic learning of the discipline (the fundamentals of algorithms and Python as a modern programming language) and at the same time they received an assignment, a problem resolution, where they had space and time to develop a game with the theme of their choice. The activity requires teamwork and creativity. As lectures run as workshops, allowing collaboration and project creation, with the help of teachers and older students as tutors. To complete the program, an event made available by the university was used as an environment, for visitors, scholars as well for high school juniors interested in software, to attend and learn about.

While the College of Engineering at the participating university saw a lot of major switching in the first year, there were not many students switching into computer science (CS). This could have been because other engineering major classes did not transfer well to CS or that students would be a year behind in the programming classes. In either case, the participating university felt that computational thinking and programming were an important part of first-year engineering exploration and believed that all 21st century engineering majors should learn to program in a general purpose language, such as Python or C++. Past research found that prior programming experience, knowledge organization, self-efficacy, and class size were factors impacting student performance in early programming courses, and learning about programming enhanced students' problem-solving skills and improved perceptions about CS. Many other research studies showed that the context in which programming material was presented to non-majors was important for their learning and interest, and themed, mixed-context courses with real-world engineering problems worked well. Therefore, in the spring 2022, we created 12, 100-person sections of a course titled “Engineering Computational and Algorithmic Thinking” for a new first-year engineering experience. Each section was taught by a different instructor representing a variety of disciplines and topics in the College of Engineering. This paper describes the research to practice and engineering student perceptions of the new, required programming class. We hypothesized that engineering students would say that the course should be required for all engineering majors, but we wanted to know why. We believed that student prior programming experience, engineering major, and other demographics would play a role in their responses. We thematically analyzed student justifications to identify emerging themes, and we used a mixed-method approach to correlate themes to different student demographics, engineering major interest, and prior programming experience. The majority of engineering students agreed that the first-year engineering course should be required, and prior programming experience and major played the largest role.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343028","Lemelson Foundation(grant numbers:20-01770); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343028","computer science;first-year engineering;programming","Knowledge engineering;Switches;Organizations;Manufacturing;Problem-solving;Engineering students;Springs","","","","34","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, in school we should not only train in linguistic and numerical literacy, but also in digital literacy. So far, the effort has been oriented mainly to convert our young people into users of computer tools. This has gone from being necessary to being insufficient, because the use of software applications means to manage a digital language that is obsolete in a time that is not proportional, in effort, to the time that has been invested in acquiring these skills. Therefore, the challenge is to prepare our young people to face the world in which they live, giving them the necessary cognitive tools to succeed in the digital world. That is, instead of teaching students only the syntax of a changing language, they should be instructed in the rules that allow them to know how the digital language is constructed.

"Computational thinking and creative practice","A. Blackwell","Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK",2012 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC),"10 Nov 2012","2012","","","3","3","End-user programmers have experiences of computation that are different from those of professional software engineers or people trained in computer science. We now understand that these different experiences arise from different motivations, different approaches to the task of programming, and different expectations about the outcomes. This talk reports results from a 10 year programme of research, engaging with collaborators who have been sought out precisely because their motivations, work methods and intentions are as different as possible from typical engineering programmers. These investigations have involved the development of a wide range of novel programmable systems and notations designed for use by choreographers, composers, musicians, and visual artists. The findings extend previous analyses of computational experience such as the attention investment model of abstraction use, and the cognitive dimensions of notations, drawing attention to ways of programming that are not only utilitarian, but playful and engaging. Research of this kind also helps us to understand that there are not necessarily different kinds of people in the world - those who are creative or not - but rather different ways of engaging with technology, available to all designers painting from the palette of human-centric computing systems.","1943-6106","978-1-4673-0853-3","10.1109/VLHCC.2012.6344467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6344467","","","","1","","","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ignoring the pragmatic reality of trying to catalog an ever-expanding corpus, one must understand that such a task is further complicated by cultural and situational bias: what is important to know at one place and time is not necessary important in another. So it is with our present day; this raises the question, what must a functioning member of society know about computing? The Web extra at http://youtu.be/PjR6GqobTBo is an audio podcast of author Grady Booch reading his On Computing column, in which he discusses how much a functioning member of society today should know about computing.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2014.128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6898799","computational thinking;programming;knowledge;information;history;software engineering","","","","","0","IEEE","15 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Through activities like Code.org's Hour of Code, these languages have become extremely popular ways to introduce programming and computational thinking to tens of millions of people of all ages and backgrounds, from grade-schoolers to President Obama. Proponents of blocks languages claim that blocks languages lower barriers to programming and enhance learning, while detractors complain that they are not particularly visual and are just toy languages from which it is difficult to transition to “real” text-based programming.","","978-1-4673-7457-6","10.1109/VLHCC.2015.7356971","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7356971","","","","","","","IEEE","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
