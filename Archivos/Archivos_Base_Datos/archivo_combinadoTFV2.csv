article,doi:10.1080/10899995.2024.2351028,"The geological sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (geo-STEM) have the capacity to investigate and address geological and environmental challenges. Many of these challenges (e.g., pollution, flooding, and slope failure) unjustly impact lower socio-economic communities in urban and rural settings where there is limited access to geo-STEM expertise. Geo-STEM learning ecosystems (GLEs) integrate geo-STEM and social science research paradigms to broaden civic engagement in the geosciences. GLEs are communities of practice consisting of geo-STEM professionals, educators, and learners who address local issues through place-based STEM research and education. The purpose of this study was to connect the concept of GLEs with the extant literature on learning ecosystems. We conducted a thematic review of the literature evaluating how the term “learning ecosystem” is used in psychology, educational technology, and STEM education research. We categorized the learning ecosystem components described in the literature in terms of inputs (e.g., motivation, software, learning environment), processes (e.g., cognition, device development, curriculum), and outputs (e.g., creativity, innovation, engagement). This approach revealed themes aligned with GLE-relevant research on communities of practice, and place-based and problem-based education, connecting GLEs to a century of existing research. To demonstrate how to use a GLE framework, we analyze the attributes of three existing programs through the GLE lens. Based on our findings, we recommend that to build GLEs geo-STEM researchers should: engage in transdisciplinary collaborations to develop local geo-STEM solutions, use the GLE framework to assess geoscience education and outreach programs, evaluate the role of place in efforts to engage diverse communities, and leverage other fields of inquiry to broaden our theoretical understanding of GLEs.",,,,"Manning, Cheryl L.B. and LaDue, N.

article,doi:10.1080/00461520.2014.1002924,"Engagement is one of the hottest research topics in the field of educational psychology. Research shows that multifarious benefits occur when students are engaged in their own learning, including increased motivation and achievement. However, there is little agreement on a concrete definition and effective measurement of engagement. This special issue serves to discuss and work toward addressing conceptual and instrumentation issues related to engagement, with particular interest in engagement in the domain of science learning. We start by describing the dimensional perspective of engagement (behavioral, cognitive, emotional, agentic) and suggest a complementary approach that places engagement instrumentation on a continuum. Specifically, we recommend that instrumentation be considered on a “grain-size” continuum that ranges from a person-centered to a context-centered orientation to clarify measurement issues.

article,doi:10.1080/17512786.2024.2404692,"Journalists often perceive that automated journalism produces news texts that lack narrative and editorial quality. Therefore, they sometimes manually edit automated output before publication, creating so-called “post-edited” variants. Using an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design, this study aims to advance research on automated journalism by investigating the steps journalists say they take when post-editing and testing whether—and if so, how—these steps are reflected systematically on a larger scale in post-edited news texts. First, journalists' statements about the post-editing process were gathered in semi-structured interviews. Then, qualitative content analysis of automated news stories and their post-edited offspring examined whether post-edited stories contain evidence of forms of editing not mentioned by the journalists. Second, the qualitative findings were investigated quantitatively using comparative content analysis (N = 282). The qualitative findings suggest that a range of editorial steps may be taken during post-editing. The quantitative analysis shows that some of these steps are reflected systematically in post-editing, resulting in significant differences between automated news stories and their post-edited offspring.

Sample: The participants of this study were 26 preservice secondary teachers who engaged in a specially designed sequence that emphasized scientific practices. Purpose: Our aim in this study was to examine the impact of this specially-designed sequence on the participants' views about the usefulness of scientific practices as a pedagogical approach, their intentions in implementing scientific practices as future teachers, and the nature of the emotions they experienced throughout their engagement in the sequence. Design and methods: Data were collected through a questionnaire, which the participants completed following their participation in the sequence. Results: The statistical analysis of the data showed that the majority of the participants: (a) perceived that they developed adequate understandings about scientific practices; (b) stated that they would implement scientific practices in their future teaching practices; and, (c) experienced positive emotions throughout their engagement in the sequence.

article,doi:10.1080/1046560X.2017.1389223,"We studied how the practices of modeling supported preservice teachers (PSTs) as a reflection tool for knowledge integration in their science methods courses. In this exploratory study, elementary (n = 4) and middle/secondary (n = 7) PSTs drew models of the process of teaching and learning, including what occurred before, during, and after teaching. Data sources included initial and final models, explanations of initial and final models, and pre- and post-interviews. We used the knowledge integration framework to explore how the PSTs' models of the process of teaching and learning changed over time and how the PSTs perceived the value of modeling the process of teaching and learning. Results indicated that developing models supported the elementary PSTs in integrating lesson planning into their conceptions of teaching, as the planning process was previously an invisible component of teaching. Among the middle/ secondary PSTs, we found that modeling supported them in integrating previously disconnected ideas into purposely linked ideas about teaching and learning as well as linking their own reflections about their teaching practice to classroom-based evidence. Finally, across the elementary and middle/secondary PSTs, we found that in drawing final models and comparing them to their initial models, they were able to identify weaknesses in their initial models and saw their individual growth in teacher knowledge during the semester. Overall, the PSTs valued the modeling activity and saw their models as a reflection tool that helped them make sense of their methods course-work.

article,doi:10.1080/1369118X.2016.1181195,"This paper outlines the notion of ‘algorithmic technique' as a middle ground between concrete, implemented algorithms and the broader study and theorization of software. Algorithmic techniques specify principles and methods for doing things in the medium of software and they thus constitute units of knowledge and expertise in the domain of software making. I suggest that algorithmic techniques are a suitable object of study for the humanities and social science since they capture the central technical principles behind actual software, but can generally be described in accessible language. To make my case, I focus on the field of information ordering and, first, discuss the wider historical trajectory of formal or ‘mechanical' reasoning applied to matters of commerce and government before, second, moving to the investigation of a particular algorithmic technique, the Bayes classifier. This technique is explicated through a reading of the original work of M. E. Maron in the early 1960 and presented as a means to subject empirical, ‘datafied' reality to an interested reading that confers meaning to each variable in relation to an operational goal. After a discussion of the Bayes classifier in relation to the question of power, the paper concludes by coming back to its initial motive and argues for increased attention to algorithmic techniques in the study of software.",,,,"Rieder, Bernhard",10.1080/1369118X.2016.1181195,,,14684462,Information Communication and Society,"Algorithmic techniques,Bayes classifier,power relations,statistics",1,100--117,,Routledge,{Scrutinizing an algorithmic technique: the Bayes classifier as interested reading of reality},https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2016.1181195,20,2017

However, the use of digital technologies is seldom a part of everyday schoolwork during the first years of primary school education. Furthermore, instruction on digital competence is often loosely connected to the students' own ideas. Since there is obviously a need to investigate student-initiated involvement, this case study examined six to seven-year-old children's views and ideas of using digital technology in school lessons through drawings and interviews. The results show that some of the students did not share the idea of using digital technology in their school lessons but most of the students did. In particular, the students expected digital devices to be used for learning, not for entertainment. Furthermore, their ideas reflected teacher-centred and student-centred approaches to learning digital competence.

The results show that while journalists interested in data are highly educated in journalism or closely related fields, they do not have a strong level of education in the more technical areas of data journalism, such as data analysis, coding and data visualisation. The study further reveals that a high proportion of data journalism courses are concentrated in the United States, with a growing number of courses developing across the world, and particularly in Europe.

article,doi:10.1080/09500693.2016.1154998,"ABSTRACT: We investigated how Chinese physics teachers structured classroom discourse to support the cognitive and social aspects of inquiry-based science learning. Regarding the cognitive aspect, we examined to what extent the cognitive processes underlying the scientific skills and the disciplinary reasoning behind the content knowledge were taught. Regarding the social aspect, we examined how classroom discourse supported student learning in terms of students' opportunities to talk and interaction patterns. Our participants were 17 physics teachers who were actively engaged in teacher education programs in universities and professional development programs in local school districts. We analyzed one lesson video from each participating teacher. The results suggest both promises and challenges. Regarding the cognitive aspect of inquiry, the teachers in general recognized the importance of teaching the cognitive processes and disciplinary reasoning. However, they were less likely to address common intuitive ideas about science concepts and principles. Regarding the social aspect of inquiry, the teachers frequently interacted with students in class. However, it appeared that facilitating conversations among students and prompting students to talk about their own ideas are challenging.

article,doi:10.1080/02635143.2022.2121692,"Background: Based on the literature review, shared characteristics of integrated STEM (I-STEM) curriculum includes an engaging and motivating context, student participation in engineering design activities, opportunity to redesign, engaging in mathematics or science content, having student-centred pedagogies, and teamwork and communication. These principles and more were used to analyse STEM activities published in NSTA journals. Purpose: It was to determine the extent to which the STEM activities published in three NSTA journals (Science and Children, Science Scope, and The Science Teacher) between the years 2013 and 2020 reflected the shared characteristics of I-STEM education. Sample: A total of 161 STEM teaching activities were analysed during the study. Methods: A STEM rubric (abbreviated as RACSTEM) developed by the authors. Expert panel reviews and intercoder agreement calculations provided support for the content validity and reliability of RACSTEM. The rubric was composed of seven main categories, namely, integrating different disciplines, real-world problem, learner-centeredness, teamwork, communication, redesign, and assessment. STEM activities were analysed based on RACSTEM through content analysis and reported using descriptive statistics. Results: Different combinations of STEM and non-STEM disciplines were integrated into the activities. 76% of the activities included real-world problems. Learner centred strategies (e.g. project-based learning) were utilized in 81% of the STEM papers. In 94% of the papers, students mostly participated in group work. Analysis revealed that 58% of the papers asked learners what they would change at the redesign stage. Finally, in the assessment aspect, the most problematic one, results showed discrepancies between the integrative nature of STEM and its assessment.

In this study, we report on a novel approach to an REU that combined the features of a traditional REU and practitioner inquiry, which we refer to as Extracurricular Practitioner Inquiry (EPI). PSTs collaboratively developed, tested, and prepared curricular units for publication as part of an extracurricular, funded project.

The ANN computational model equips English teachers with the ability to quickly find the predicting factors to learners' overall English competences and also provides teachers with the ability to find abnormal students, based on reviewing their individualized ANN trajectories. Finally, by observing the compound effects of cognitive factors using the same evaluation scale, new hypotheses about the mutual relationships among the phonological awareness, phonological short-term memory, and long-term memory abilities of their students can be generated.

article,doi:10.1080/1046560X.2018.1514825,"Contemporary research has suggested that for students to compete globally, pedagogy must shift to emphasize the infusion of mathematics into science instruction to strengthen understanding. Innovative professional development programs are necessary to achieve this goal, particularly with respect to teaching graphing skills in the context of science. Although there is literature to substantiate that students respond positively in terms of interest, there has been little evidence to support improved science performance when both subjects are integrated. This large-scale quasi-experimental study examined impacts of a mathematics-infused science curriculum on students' science attitudes and achievement (N =1695). Data were collected from science assessments and attitudes surveys in mathematics-infused 8th grade science classrooms and compared to those from students in non-integrated settings. Data revealed positive student outcomes, including the ability to understand mathematics-infused scientific concepts (F(1, 1693) = 17.02, p <.001), higher confidence in graphing, and greater agreement with the notion that mathematics is a valuable tool in learning science (F(1, 1693) = 33.76, p <.001).

The interdisciplinary project team immersed teachers in experiencing innovative, standards-based, three-dimensional (3D) earth and space science (ESS) curricular units with embedded disciplinary literacy (DL) strategies. Teachers then adapted the 3D+DL units and implemented with students. Researchers used a convergent parallel mixed methods design to examine quantitative and qualitative data in the form of classroom observations to determine fidelity of implementation of 3D+DL practices, frequency of 3D+DL practices on the self-reported Science Literacy Survey, and focus group interviews to assess impacts of the PD project on teaching. Analyses revealed that teachers valued and embraced 3D+DL instructional shifts that supported teacher and student sensemaking in science. Teachers attributed project success to (a) project team collaboration to develop ESS units, (b) adaptability of ESS units, (c) explicit and direct instruction of 3D+DL, and (d) teacher sharing and reflecting on student success. The shift in teachers' understanding and practices of 3D+DL teaching and learning is likely attributed to teachers having the opportunity for sensemaking as learners with rigorous ESS units prior to implementing 3D+DL instruction with their students, which may provide guidance for future PD.",,,,"Thomas, Jeffrey D. and Drew, Sally Valentino",10.1080/1046560X.2021.1898763,,,15731847,Journal of Science Teacher Education,"Next Generation Science Standards,design-based research,disciplinary literacy,practice-based professional development,three-dimensional",1,1--31,,Routledge,{Impact of A Practice-Based Professional Development on Secondary Science Teachers' Use of Disciplinary Literacy Practices: A Design Research Project},https://doi.org/10.1080/1046560X.2021.1898763,33,2022

Purpose: This research investigates the effectiveness of a professional development program enriched by the skills-based science, technology, engineering, and mathematics model (SB-STEM-M) on preservice science teachers' self-efficacy. Sample: The participants of this study are twenty preservice teachers in a state university science education program. Design and Methods: This research was carried out over 14 weeks using mixed-methods research, with the implementation process consisting of three stages, with the last stage involving the preservice teachers' preparation of SB-STEM activity sets alongside evaluations, and feedback. The quantitative data in the research were obtained using the Self-Efficacy and Concerns about STEM Education Instrument, which was used as a pre-and post-test. The qualitative data were obtained through the activity sets and videos the preservice teachers prepared based on SB-STEM-M as well as through interview forms and focus group interviews. Results: The results from the quantitative and qualitative data analyses show the preservice teachers' STEM self-efficacy to have improved using the professional development program enriched with SB-STEM-M, while no change had occurred regarding their STEM concerns like information and evaluation, management, consequence and refocusing. Conclusion: The three-stage intervention process applied to the preservice teachers enabled them to both develop original STEM activity sets in accordance with SB-STEM-M as well as to increase their STEM self-efficacy.

This paper asks what the barriers are to a mutually beneficial relationship between the two disciplines. A two-phase qualitative interview study was used to explore the relationship between school science and mathematics education through the perspectives of science and mathematics education policy-makers and of teachers in departments which are unusual in collaborating. In total there were 36 participants. Interview data were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings show that there is an asymmetry in the dependency between school science and mathematics: science is dependent on mathematics but the reverse is not true. We discuss three consequences of this asymmetric dependency: there is greater benefit for science from any collaboration; ‘maths blame' can arise from science teacher frustration; and science educators may believe they should have some ownership of the mathematics curriculum. Asymmetry of dependency, and therefore of benefit, will make it very difficult for mathematics and science to work together in a way which is genuinely mutually beneficial.",,,,"Wong, Victoria and Dillon, Justin",10.1080/09500693.2019.1579945,,,14645289,International Journal of Science Education,"Mathematics,collaboration,curriculum,policy development,secondary/high school",6,782--802,,Routledge,"{‘Voodoo maths', asymmetric dependency and maths blame: why collaboration between school science and mathematics teachers is so rare}",https://doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2019.1579945,41,2019
article,doi:10.1080/02635143.2022.2126973,"Background: It is critical to analyse and evaluate elementary school students' scientific inquiry skills to promote inquiry-based teaching and learning and to develop students' scientific inquiry skills. Compared with the analysis of students' scientific inquiry skills based on paper and pen tests and classroom teaching videos, the direct analysis of primary school students' video works on the scientific inquiry can more intuitively and comprehensively reflect students' actual scientific inquiry ability. Purpose: This study aims to analyse scientific inquiry abilities of students in Chinese elementary school through video works and to reflect students' scientific inquiry abilities authentically and comprehensively by using performance assessment. Sample: 32 high-integrity physics videos on material science topics were further evaluated for analysis. Design and Methods: The study proposed the analytical framework of students' scientific inquiry skills combined with the existing research, and the content analysis of the participating videos was carried out accordingly, which realized the performance assessment of students' scientific inquiry skills. Results: Only 40.59%entries had completed elements of scientific inquiry. The scores for hypothesis making and reflection evaluation were 1.37 and 1.71, which were relatively complex and showed that students' performance was weak. The highest scores for the ability to inquire and the view of scientific inquiry were gotten by the students in grade 4 and no outstanding performance was shown by the students in grade 6. Conclusion: First, the lowest level of scientific inquiry was found in making hypotheses and reflective evaluation performance. Second, students' scientific inquiry skills did't show a dominant correlation with grade, and students' inquiry skills don't necessarily increase naturally with increased knowledge and skills. In addition, the degree of openness to inquiry did not fully characterize students' inquiry skills. Finally, students with a more systematic view of scientific inquiry had relatively higher inquiry skills.",,,,"Zheng, Yonghe and Yu, Shuwen and Zhang, Mian and Wang, Jingying and Yang, Xuanyang and Zheng, Sheng and Ping, Xiaomei",10.1080/02635143.2022.2126973,,,14701138,Research in Science and Technological Education,"Inquiry skills,elementary schools,performance assessment,video analysis",3,720--746,,Routledge,{Research on performance assessment of students' inquiry skills in China's elementary schools: a video analysis of Beijing discovering science around us},https://doi.org/10.1080/02635143.2022.2126973,42,2024

MMM applies to a wide range of phenomena, targeting learning transfer and generalization. Design principles of MMM are presented and discussed based on a study with seventh-grade students. The study is a quasi-experimental, pretest-intervention-posttest control-comparison-group design. Findings from a quantitative analysis of the questionnaires show that engaging students with the construction of models using MMM significantly promoted students' conceptual learning and enhanced their systems' thinking compared with a comparison group who followed a normative curriculum. Students' responses to the worksheets showed mutual effects between improving the practice of modeling and promoting conceptual understanding and systems thinking.

Findings demonstrate that existing models are mostly early-stage proposals addressing competences featured in mainstream 21st-century and digital-competence frameworks. Worker-level factors explicitly aligned with emerging cyber-physical systems receive little attention. To construct a worker-readiness model calibrated to the needs of Industry 4.0, the authors devised a research procedure based on a two-phase integrative review of 135 publications. Firstly, they deployed an activity-system apparatus to produce a structured description of the target environment. Secondly, major worker competence groupings, aligned with this target, were extracted, tagged and reduced to five dimensions. The resulting model consolidates prior research and introduces two original competence groupings addressing human-machine partnering and decision-making in Industry 4.0. This study is a foundational step by the Educational Informatics Lab, Ontario Tech University, Canada, toward deploying a global online profile tool for generating, analysing and aggregating worker readiness profiles.

The limitations of the existing conventional laboratory work can be potentially overcome by the implementation of the innovative use of smartphones as an experimental tool due to its effectiveness and convenience to apply anywhere and anytime. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a sound STEM practical kit using free mobile apps for secondary school students. This study also examined student perceptions of the implementation of the developed sound practical kit. Sample: Two intact Form 2 classes of secondary school students from a mainstream school in the state of Perak, Malaysia, were chosen using the cluster sampling method as research sample. One of the classes was selected as an experimental group (n = 36 students) with the implementation of developed sound practical kit, while the other class was a comparison group (n = 30 students) employing a conventional teaching method. Methods: A developmental research design according to the ASSURE (Analyse learners; State objectives; Select media and materials; Utilise media and materials; Require learner participation; and Evaluate) instructional design model and quasi-experimental were employed in this study. A set of achievement test and open-ended questions were employed as research instruments. The data were analysed using a non-parametric test that included Mann-Whitney test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, while the students' feedbacks and comments were analysed using Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) software. Results: The findings demonstrated a significant difference between the posttest of the comparison group and the experimental group students.

We use thematic analysis to describe how three main pedagogic approaches–guided hands-on, peer learning and contextualisation–were experienced by learners. The study suggests that mapping pedagogic practices to the dimensions of the framework can be of value to those designing courses to suit the diverse interests of students seeking an introduction to coding.",,,,"Tarling, Georgie and Melro, Ana and {Kleine Staarman}, Judith and Fujita, Taro",10.1080/1554480X.2022.2077338,,,15544818,Pedagogies,"Coding,bootcamps,learning opportunities,pedagogic practices",4,578--595,,Routledge,{Making coding meaningful: university students' perceptions of bootcamp pedagogies},https://doi.org/10.1080/1554480X.2022.2077338,18,2023
article,doi:10.1080/03055698.2016.1193475,"In the last two decades Dutch primary school students scored below expectation in international mathematics tests. An explanation for this may be that teachers fail to adequately assess their students' understanding of learning goals and provide timely feedback. To improve the teachers' formative assessment practice, researchers, curriculum experts and teachers worked together to develop a model for classroom formative assessment (CFA). In three pilot studies, six teachers from three different schools implemented the CFA-model and evaluated its feasibility together with the researchers by means of checklists. The CFA-model was primarily changed with regard to the assessment techniques. Teachers indicated that classroom management and preparation time were preconditions for an optimal implementation. Analysis of covariance was used to explore students' learning outcomes. The results showed that a correct implementation of the CFA-model might result in the enhancement of students' mathematical performance. The implications of the three pilots for the implementation of the CFA-model on a larger scale are discussed.",,,,"van den Berg, M. and Harskamp, E. G. and Suhre, C.

The model (EzGCM) is a data-driven, computer-based climate modeling tool use to explore global climate data. Multiple sources of data collection, including teacher interviews, classroom observations, and daily reflections, were employed to address the research question: “How did two teachers' implementation strategies evolve over the three-year study while utilizing a model-based, climate-focused curriculum?” This study provides insight into how and why these resources [model-based climate education curricula] are utilized in science learning environments, thereby informing ongoing efforts to enhance climate education and, in doing so, preparing the next generation of climate-literate adults prepared to confront this most critical global challenge of our age. The findings showed while both teachers engaged in increasingly model-centric instructional practices, these changes were modest. Furthermore, both teacher's observed classroom practices were less model-centric than the designed curriculum.

article,doi:10.1080/2331186X.2023.2280309,"One of the challenges of sustainable education in the post-pandemic world is students' writing anxiety. The present study aimed to answer two key questions about writing in a second language for Arabic-English speakers enrolled in a written communication course after a return to on-campus instruction. First, it examined whether early exposure to English would predict diminished anxiety. Then, it assessed whether anxiety predicted specific writing deficits in the quality and quantity of students' writing. Students completed a writing anxiety questionnaire, answered questions about their exposure to English and their attitudes toward English writing, and responded in writing to the query “Who am I?”. In this correlational study, overall anxiety increased with students' later exposure to English and decreased with exposure to English-speaking media, and favorable attitudes toward English writing. Overall anxiety was linked to particular writing qualities, such as increased use of concrete words, and brevity of exposition. Yet, somatic anxiety, appraisal concerns, communication apprehension, and avoidance behaviors were differentially related to measures of English exposure and attitudes as well as to writing quality and quantity. For instance, late exposure to English writing was related to increased levels of appraisal concerns, somatic anxiety, and communication apprehension, but not to avoidance behaviors.

article,doi:10.1080/13528165.2021.1977526,"This article considers the relationship between perception, language and embodiment in altered or expanded states of consciousness in queer-feminist writing that turns text into performance. How might these processes of perception—often ineffable, numinous, non-discursive and/or irrational, be articulated through language, narrative or discourse? What forms of knowledge production might these processes of perception lead to? How do they influence thinking, concepts of self and experience of reality and consciousness? I address these questions by bringing notions of altered, expanded and intuitive perception into conversation with psychedelic (and more broadly, consciousness) studies and queer-feminist epistemologies through analysis of the work of Gloria Anzald{\'{u}}a. Drawing upon notions of the embodied mind, which suggest that the mind and body not only work in tandem but are conceptualized through environmental, relational, affective and other contextual influences, I explore how the dynamic relationship between text, embodiment and reality in Anzald{\'{u}}a's writing articulates what I call ‘psychedelic' perception. I use this term to refer to certain forms of altered, expanded and intuitive perception that grapple with sensory experiences in immaterial, spiritual, imaginary and psychic realms. Furthermore, psychedelic perception attempts to situate these sensory experiences in the context of one's interiority, especially for the purposes of self-transformation and psycho-spiritual healing. I argue that Anzald{\'{u}}a's engagements with language and writing can be read as forms of performance, due to her creative processes of ‘re-visioning' reality and the shifts they enact in perception, cognition, and reality itself through embodiment and alternative forms of knowledge production. Additionally, I explore tensions and trouble binary oppositions between ‘ordinary' and ‘nonordinary' states of consciousness and how they interact with discursive and non-discursive, as well as universal and particular aspects of meaning-making and knowledge production.",,,,"Li, Deni",10.1080/13528165.2021.1977526,,,13528165,Performance Research,,3,114--124,,Routledge,{Psychedelic Perception in Queer-Feminist Reading and Writing (as Performance)},https://doi.org/10.1080/13528165.2021.1977526,26,2021

While prior studies on digital literacy and play have explored children's digital interactions with media, children's play around media is increasingly traversing online-offline boundaries. Consequently, we argue that to fully comprehend how children build up understandings of the digital, paradoxically, we should also consider how they engage with digital media in offline settings. Drawing upon participants observations of 8–12-year-old children attending afterschool childcare (N = 77) and in-depth interviews with children, their parents, and pedagogical staff in The Netherlands, we develop a typology of practices of converged play through which children replicate, remix, and re-enact digital media in everyday life. Our findings emphasize that children's digital literacy is foremost a social practice developed primarily in relation with others, within and beyond the digital realm. Thus, we argue that taking a sociocultural and non-media centric approach to play is vital for understanding children's development of digital literacy, in a way that does justice to children's continuous exposure to and immersion in digital media in everyday life.",,,,"Swart, Jo{\""{e}}lle and Stegeman, Hanne and Frowijn, Lucy and Broersma, Marcel",10.1080/17482798.2023.2291014,,,17482801,Journal of Children and Media,"Afterschool childcare,audience studies,children,converged play,digital literacy,ethnography,non-media centric approach,sociocultural theory",1,138--154,,Routledge,{The paradox of play: How Dutch children develop digital literacy via offline engagement with digital media},https://doi.org/10.1080/17482798.2023.2291014,18,2024

On the one hand, there is a call for improved media technologies enabling greater immediacy of semantic feedback supporting a faster, more fluid—perhaps even virtuoso—approach to improvisation. Alongside, there remains interest within the live coding community for a mode of improvisational performativity that harnesses the unpredictable, the unexpected or as-yet-unknown. Rather than regard these two tendencies in antagonistic relation, my intent is to invite further debate on how the development of intelligent machines might better facilitate improvisatory flow, without eradicating the critical intervals and in-between spaces necessary for creative invention and intervention, without smoothing away the points of technical resistance and intransigence which arguably form a part of live coding's performative texture.",,,,"Cocker, Emma",10.1080/14626268.2017.1419978,,,17443806,Digital Creativity,"Live coding,improvisation,kairos,thinking-in-action,thought-in-motion",1,82--95,,CAA Website,"{What now, what next—kairotic coding and the unfolding future seized}",https://doi.org/10.1080/14626268.2017.1419978,29,2018

article,doi:10.1080/00221686.2019.1702595,"By the late nineteenth century, the scientific study of bedload transport had emerged as an offshoot of hydraulics and geomorphology. Since then, computing bedload transport rates has attracted considerable attention, but whereas other environmental sciences have seen their predictive capacities grow over time, particularly thanks to increased computing power, engineers and scientists are unable to predict bedload transport rates to within better than one order of magnitude. Why have we failed to improve our predictive capacity to any significant degree? A commonly shared view is that the study of bedload transport has more in common with the earth sciences than hydraulics: bedload transport rates depend on many processes that vary nonlinearly, involve various time and space scales, and are interrelated to each other. All this makes it difficult to view bedload as merely particle transport in a turbulent flow–something which can be studied in the laboratory in isolation from the natural environment. Over the last two decades, more emphasis has been put on the noisy dynamics characterizing bedload transport. This Vision Paper makes a strong case for recognizing noise (e.g. bedload transport rate fluctuations) as an intrinsic feature of bedload transport. Improving our predictive capacities requires a better understanding of the origins and nature of noise in bedload transport.

We examined preservice teachers' (n = 19) perceptions of design thinking mindsets and processes as well as perceived changes in their understanding of “teachers as designers.” A qualitative analysis of weekly student reflections and final reflection reports revealed that design thinking processes contributed to preservice teachers' understanding of the design thinking role in education, its challenges, and design mindsets.

article,doi:10.1080/1046560X.2021.1961974,"Recent national reforms focus on learning disciplinary core ideas through engaging in science and engineering practices. These reforms also call for students and teachers to use crosscutting concepts (CCCs), or analytical lenses, that support scientific sensemaking and connections across disciplines. The Framework for K-12 Science Education (National Research Council, 2012) posits that CCCs must be made explicit to provide students with access to scientific sensemaking processes. This study analyzes class dialogue during the implementation of an NGSS-aligned curricular unit that integrates science, engineering, and computational modeling for fifth-grade students. The analysis focuses on the implicit and explicit use of CCCs to support student learning. Findings show that although the CCC of systems and system models was the focus of the unit and professional development, systems appeared in the class dialogue much less frequently than other CCCs, and teachers used all of the CCCs at some point during the unit. With the exception of patterns, all references to CCCs were implicit within the classroom dialogue. This study provides evidence that the CCCs play an important part in classroom conversation that focuses on integrating disciplinary core ideas with science and engineering practices.

article,doi:10.1080/03057267.2016.1206351,"Despite the importance of scientific inquiry in science education, researchers and educators disagree considerably regarding what features define this instructional approach. While a large body of literature addresses theoretical considerations, numerous empirical studies investigate scientific inquiry on quite different levels of detail and also on different theoretical grounds. Here, only little systematic research has analysed the different conceptualisations and usages of the overarching construct of scientific inquiry in detail. To close this gap, a review of the research literature on scientific inquiry was conducted based on a widespread approach to defining scientific inquiry as activities that students engage in. The main goal is to provide a systematic overview about the range and spectrum of definitions and operationalisations used with regard to single activities of the inquiry process in empirical studies. The findings from the review first and foremost illustrate the variability in the ways these activities have been operationalised and implemented. For each activity, studies differ significantly not only with respect to the focus, explicitness and comprehensiveness of their operationalisations but also with regard to the consistency of their implementation in the form of instructional or interventional components in the study and/or in the focus of the assessment of student performance. This has significant implications regarding the validity and comparability of results obtained in different studies, e.g. in the context of discussions concerning the effectiveness of inquiry-based instruction.

Findings demonstrated centering science while lacing engineering throughout allowed for a slight increase in the understanding that engineers use science and math, however, centering engineering allowed students to understand many more attributes of engineers (i.e., engineers invent/design/create, improve things, fix, and solve problems) after instruction than they did prior to instruction. These findings and their limitations are discussed in relation to the developing Nature of Engineering framework and the new content demands of the U.S. Next Generation Science Standards.",,,,"Driessen, Emily P. and Wilhelm, Jennifer and Cole, Merryn and Dunn, Ashley and Anderson, Kameisha",10.1080/00220671.2022.2158156,,,19400675,Journal of Educational Research,"Design,education interviews,learning,nature of engineering,science education,surveys",1,1--16,,Routledge,{The impacts of two curricula on middle-level students' engineering understanding},https://doi.org/10.1080/00220671.2022.2158156,116,2023

article,doi:10.1080/03057267.2016.1275380,"Making is a rapidly emerging form of educational practice that involves the design, construction, testing, and revision of a wide variety of objects, using high and low technologies, and integrating a range of disciplines including art, science, engineering, and mathematics. It has garnered widespread interest and support in both policy and education circles because of the ways it has been shown to link science learning to creativity and investigation. Making has taken root in out-of-school settings, such as museums, science festivals, and afterschool and library programmes; and there is now growing interest from primary and secondary educators in how it might be incorporated into the classroom. Making expands on traditions associated with Technology Education and Design-Based Learning, but differs in ways that can potentially broaden participation in science and STEM learning to include learners from communities historically underrepresented in STEM fields. STEM-Rich Making is centrally organised around design and engineering practices, typically integrating digital tools and computational practices, and positions scientific and mathematical concepts and phenomena as the materials for design. This paper takes a critical view of the claims about Making as a productive form of science teaching and learning, and reviews the current research literature's substantiation of the ways in which Making supports students' agency, promotes active participation in science and engineering practices, and leverages learners' cultural resources.",,,,"Bevan, Bronwyn",10.1080/03057267.2016.1275380,,,19408412,Studies in Science Education,"Maker Education,Maker Movement,Making,STEM,broadening participation,equity,inclusion,informal,practical work,tinkering",1,75--103,,Routledge,{The promise and the promises of Making in science education},https://doi.org/10.1080/03057267.2016.1275380,53,2017

Prior research has identified key dimensions of goal structures, but a more nuanced examination of the variability of teacher-enacted and student-perceived goal structures within and across classrooms is needed. Using a concurrent mixed-methods approach, we developed case studies of how three 7th-grade science teachers enacted different goal structures while teaching the same chemistry unit and how their students perceived these goal structures. Student perceptions were largely consistent with our observational analysis and suggested that a positive social climate and autonomy support are important elements of mastery goal structure. However, balancing socio-emotional support with sufficient academic rigor may be especially important for students with high levels of mastery goal orientation and self-efficacy in science. Implications for research include the need for further research linking classroom stimuli to variability in perceived goal structure, especially across students with different motivational characteristics.

However, teachers have often experienced STEM in limited ways in their own education and are thereby provided with few resources for re-imagining these disciplines. While teacher educators have designed learning environments that engage teachers in new forms of disciplinary activities, there have been few accounts that describe how teachers make connections between these experiences and dominant narratives that impact their own and their students' learning. In this study, I report on the experiences of Alma, a white, working-class, female elementary teacher in an online graduate certificate program for K-12 engineering educators. Through her engagement in engineering design in the program, Alma appropriated—transformed and made her own—discourse of the engineering design process in ways that trouble some of the narratives that restrict her, her family, and her students in STEM and in school.

But how do kids manage the motivational and cognitive challenges of creating projects? Methods: I examined this question in the context of kids working at home with the Scratch programming environment, based on thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 30 young creators discussing their project development processes. Findings: Ten strategies were central to kids' progress with their projects: experimenting, planning, compromising, persevering, taking a break, asking for help, studying projects, adapting projects, creating with others, and helping others learn. Drawing on structuration theory, which frames an individual's purposeful actions as connected to the internal and external structures to which they have access, I recast these kids' strategies as connected to three key structures—personal interests, access to others, and time—with both enabling and inhibiting effects. Contribution: This study contributes to decades-long conversations about self-directed learning, offering a new view into the relationship between structure and self-direction by applying structuration theory to informal computer science learning. It offers a set of structures to consider when designing in support of self-direction, and acknowledges the prior problem-solving strategies that learners may bring to new areas of learning.",,,,"Brennan, Karen",10.1080/10508406.2021.1936531,,,10508406,Journal of the Learning Sciences,,4-5,576--610,,Routledge,{How kids manage self-directed programming projects: Strategies and structures},https://doi.org/10.1080/10508406.2021.1936531,30,2021
article,doi:10.1080/02103702.1992.10822322,"Piaget's (1953, 1955) increasingly controversial claim that infant knowledge depends upon action need not be rejected, provided the mechanisms underlying infant ability are conceptualized appropriately in computational terms. Computational concepts solve many problems caused by Piaget's notions of perception, behaviour, schemes, reciprocal-assimilation and action. Artificial intelligence work on vision offers a way of explaining early perceptual abilities that is precise, internally coherent and able to encompass recent findings of innate organization. Concepts from the procedural programming languages offer a way of accounting for both internal and overt aspects of behaviour, and for the functional coordination of perception and behaviour that characterizes infant action. This perspective challenges Piaget's view that development necessitates a radical reconstruction of action-based knowledge. Conceptualized computationally, perceptual-behavioural action can be seen to involve representation in a nontrivial sense. Restructuring of action mechanisms can account for some central phenomena of infant development. {\textcopyright} 1992, Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Methods: In a yearlong critical ethnographic study with 12 youth makers, we investigated how youth engaged with and redefined entrepreneurialism through their identity work as justice-oriented, community makers. Findings: Examining youth experiences of entering their making designs into a regional youth Entrepreneurial Faire, we found that the dominant cultures of making and entrepreneurialism at the Faire presented limited opportunities for equitable participation in either. However, youth makers' community justice-oriented efforts disrupted relationships of power among youth, adults, STEM-rich making, and society. Their critical youth approach argued for a new vision for entrepreneurialism/entrepreneurship. Youth reconfigured a critical maker-entrepreneurialism through practices multidimensionally grounded in a) re-humanizing making and b) building community. Their public discourses highlighted what this effort could produce for community justice and community well-being. Their critical reconfiguration actions revealed and challenged inequitable values and practices driven by inherent White, male, middle-class bias and neoliberalism.

In “Mister Squishy,” the lead story in Oblivion (2004), the threat of information overload and the attendant crisis of narrative are thematized through the story's staging of a central tension between statistical (quantitative) and narrative (qualitative) significance. Despite its numerous “anti-narrative” features, “Mister Squishy” is rather ingeniously designed to compel the reader's narrative interest and participation by exploiting natural readerly “needs”–for narrative relevance, coherence, and closure. Wallace activates these readerly needs through his careful manipulation of how and when key information is revealed. The story's dramatic shifts in pacing and perspective, and its oscillations between narration and description, combine to create extraordinary moments of suspense and surprise which drive both plot and reader forward. In this way “Mister Squishy” plays with the cognitive-affective dynamics of storytelling throughout, foregrounding them for our reflection.

To better understand these dynamics, we detail the construct of racial literacy and develop an interpretative framework of racial-ideological micro-contestations. Through an in-depth analysis of a classroom interaction using this framework, we explore how contestations about race can emerge when data visualizations from the public media are incorporated into STEM learning precisely because the contexts of data are often racialized.

article,doi:10.1080/21670811.2022.2061550,"This article presents an analysis of metadiscourses used by professionals and institutions that practice data-driven journalism (DDJ) in Brazil. It aims to understand how they define this practice and seek autonomy within the journalistic field. We conducted an argumentative analysis of editorial texts from 15 news outlets and carried out in-depth interviews with 33 professionals in the field, which allowed us to identify three prevalent metadiscourses: (1) cyberactivism; (2) reinforcing traditional journalistic values; and (3) authority. Using boundary-work as a theoretical basis for the analyses we discovered that all the discourses in these self-referential texts expressed some degree of disruption in DDJ, especially regarding data and its ability to reshape the concept of news transparency and introduce the values and practices of hacktivism in journalism. These discourses also reinforce elements of continuity and suggest a conservative restoration of production routines, values, and conventions in journalism without changing the basic ideology of the profession.

This perspective has influenced the development of PRIMM (Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify, Make), a structured approach to teaching programming. Objective: The objective of the study was to find out if using PRIMM to teach programming had an impact on learner attainment in secondary school, and the extent to which it was valuable for teachers. Method: We evaluated the use of PRIMM in 13 schools with 493 students aged 11-14 alongside a control group, using a mixed-methods approach. Teachers delivered programming lessons using the PRIMM approach for 8-12 weeks. Data were collected via a combination of a baseline test, a post-test to compare control and experimental groups, and teacher interviews. Findings: Learners performed better in the post test than the control group. Teachers reported several benefits of the PRIMM approach, including that PRIMM helped them to teach effectively in mixed-ability classes, enabling all learners to make progress.

The implementation of the subject in many schools is, however, characterized by a myriad of challenges, including pedagogical affordances, especially within early stages of basic education. There is a need, therefore, to understand how children within primary education can be supported to learn computing. Objective: This study explored the young learners' conception of computing concepts, specifically with regard to computers, the internet, code, and artificial intelligence (AI) in an out-of-school setting. Method: A qualitative draw-and-talk technique was adopted to understand how 12 children aged 5–8 years think about computing concepts. Findings: The results of our study revealed that young learners are familiar with computers as a device and what the internet does; however, programming, and emerging technology like AI were alien to them. Furthermore, our study revealed that the ideas generated by the students mainly emerged from observation and interaction with their guardians, parents, or other adults, including the media. Implications: While children's conception and experience in computing education in Africa is under-researched, exploring the population within early stages of basic education is almost inexistent.

These approaches should be particularly useful because the need for scalable project-based and student-centered learning is growing considerably. In this article, we present studies focused on how students learn computer programming, based on data drawn from 154,000 code snapshots of computer programs under development by approximately 370 students enrolled in an introductory undergraduate programming course. We use methods from machine learning to discover patterns in the data and try to predict final exam grades. We begin with a set of exploratory experiments that use fully automated techniques to investigate how much students change their programming behavior throughout all assignments in the course. The results show that students' change in programming patterns is only weakly predictive of course performance. We subsequently hone in on 1 single assignment, trying to map students' learning process and trajectories and automatically identify productive and unproductive (sink) states within these trajectories. Results show that our process-based metric has better predictive power for final exams than the midterm grades.

We found that a majority of the studies focused on the validity vertex, as compared to the other two vertices. The existing studies primarily involve text recognition, classification, and scoring with an emphasis on constructing scientific explanations, with a vast range of human-machine agreement measures. To achieve the agreement measures, most of the studies employed a cross-validation method, rather than self- or split-validation. ML allows complex assessments to be used by teachers without the burden of human scoring, saving both time and cost. Most studies used supervised ML, which relies on extraction of attributes from student work that was first coded by humans to achieve automaticity, rather than semi- or unsupervised ML. We found that 24 studies were explicitly embedded in science learning activities, such as scientific inquiry and argumentation, to provide feedback or learning guidance.

The study was designed as nonequivalent control-group pretest-posttest, and it was carried out with 43 students. Participants were chosen according to the convenient sampling method. The authors collected data from the test of SPSs assessment, worksheets, or experiment reports. While the control group received a regular teaching approach over existing science curriculum, an instructional intervention by emphasizing SPSs via multiple types of practical activities was used to improve SPSs of the experimental group. Data obtained were analyzed both for inferential and descriptive purposes. The results indicated a significant difference between the experimental group's pretest and posttest scores related to the assessment SPSs.

Despite the limitations of the study such as small sample size, lack of analysis of the long-term students' outcomes of SPSs, and no collection of performance-based assessment data from the control group, the authors suggest that the experimental group improved their SPSs via the instructional intervention more than the control group students.

Schools are responsible for ensuring that all students cultivate sophisticated sociodigital competences and mindsets needed for studying and collaborating through and around technology and overcoming digital challenges encountered. Although some schools have successfully integrated digital technologies into traditional schoolwork, students are not provided sufficient structured training in creative and academic practices of using digital technologies. This study explored changes before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in Finnish primary and middle school students' perceived sociodigital study practices, competences, mindsets, and profiles. Participants were asked to respond to the Sociodigital Practices Inventory (SDPi), which assessed their sociodigital study practices, competences, and mindset. The participants consisted of 947 cohort 1 students (5th grade in 2019 and 6th grade in 2020) and 771 cohort 2 students (7th grade in 2019 and 8th grade in 2020). The results revealed subtle changes in students' perceptions regarding schools' digital practices; primary school students experienced an increase in basic practices while middle schoolers experienced a decrease in perceived advanced practices. Both boys' and girls' self-evaluated academic sociodigital competences increased from 2019 to 2020, while their artistic and technical competences decreased. Primary school boys' sociodigital mindsets increased, while that of middle school girls decreased.

Observational and interview research data were organized and analyzed for patterns, themes, and relationships. Three main themes were identified: (1) the makerspace design, activities, and teacher's role are impacted by the reasons and goals teachers espouse for establishing them; (2) all three sites provided limited scaffolds for the making process–five different forms of teachers' scaffolding were identified; and (3) while advanced technologies (robotics, 3D printing) were present, their use was limited as they required significant troubleshooting by the teacher and close supervision.

In this article, we review evidence concerning this equity gap, including the importance of STEM education to CWD. We find that the early years provide an exceptional opportunity to introduce STEM, but that this potential is often left unrealized, especially for young vulnerable children, who live in poverty, are members of linguistic and ethnic minority groups, or are CWD (some with particular disabilities in STEM domains). Research also indicates the success of some educational approaches. Practice or Policy: Research and development in each of the STEM domains, as well as interdisciplinary approaches provides directions for both policy and practice.

Method: Five academic databases were searched to identify literature meeting our inclusion criteria and resulted in 13 publications with 52 effect size comparisons on both cognitive and affective outcomes. Findings: We found small effect size (g = 0.245; p = .137; with a 95% confidence interval of −0.078 to 0.567) in favor of block-based programming environments on cognitive outcomes, and a trivial effect size (g = 0.195, p = .429; with a 95% confidence interval of −0.289 to 0.678) on affective outcomes. Both effect size calculations were statistically insignificant using random effects models. The effect sizes were examined for moderating effects by education level, learning environment, and study duration. Some evidence of publication bias was detected in these data.

Formality of the program context did not substantially influence attitude changes but did appear to influence learning outcomes. While intrinsic motivation did not change in the aggregate from pre- to post-program among students, positive changes in intrinsic motivation were found to be associated with engagement in almost all areas of student engagement in Globaloria, with several at-home engagement changes measured. This finding challenges critiques of discovery-based learning as being de-motivating. Lower parent education among students was associated with positive changes in self-efficacy for online research indicating that disadvantaged students may stand to benefit from programs like this one.

Thus, without targeted policies and interventions, the adoption of 4IR technologies may lead to greater unemployment and increased inequality, particularly affecting low-skilled workers and marginalized communities in South Africa. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of how these changes can impact employment in different sectors will allow a smooth proposal of strategies to mitigate adverse effects while capitalizing on new opportunities. In doing so, the current paper uses the feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) estimation technique to examine the impact of the 4IR technologies on aggregate and disaggregated sectoral employment in South Africa from 2000 to 2021, aiming to assess how the technology advancements are reshaping the labor market across various sectors in South Africa. The results indicate that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) exports and imports and high technology exports negatively affect sectoral employment in South Africa. However, research and development, fixed broadband, internet usage, and mobile phone usage positively affect sectoral employment in the short run. Again, the sectoral analysis shows that the different 4IR indicators have a disparate effect on employment at the sectoral level.

Our results showed that Byram's intercultural communicative competence model, sociocultural theory, and social constructivism were the most frequently used theoretical foundations. The participants frequently used discussion forums, Facebook, email, and Skype. English was the most popular language, and American culture received more attention than any other culture. In terms of the methodology, most studies were conducted for four to 18 weeks, and undergraduate students with advanced language skills were the most frequent participants. The participants interacted with their partners, e.g., introduced cultural backgrounds, created collaborative products, and reflected on learning experiences. Researchers in most studies used questionnaires and interviews to collect the data, and their results demonstrated that intercultural telecollaboration in foreign language education promotes language and culture learning.

Findings show that implementation positively affected teachers' dispositions toward using authentic data and real-world media about scientific research to explain how people impact ecological function. Teachers also demonstrated increased appreciation and capacity for using data and media for learning how humans disrupt ecological function. Importantly, prior to implementation, 42 % of teachers specifically reported not using data when teaching human impact. Additionally, content analysis of teachers' lesson plan reports shows that focusing lesson plans around data and media can support teachers in making human impact lessons more specific and that a data- and media-centered curriculum can assist teachers in moving away from discussions of the generalized effect of people on the environment to specific real-world examples of how humans impact ecological function. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Association for Science Teacher Education, USA.",,,,"Wyner, Yael",10.1007/s10972-013-9335-2,,,1046560X,Journal of Science Teacher Education,"Curriculum,Ecology,Environmental education,Media,Scientific data",5,833--857,,Routledge,{The Impact of a Novel Curriculum on Secondary Biology Teachers' Dispositions Toward Using Authentic Data and Media in Their Human Impact and Ecology Lessons},https://doi.org/10.1007/s10972-013-9335-2,24,2013

Also, the results revealed similarities/differences between the ways instructors, students, and practicing engineers judged design projects. In light of these findings, it appears ACJ can be a valuable formative assessment tool for informing the practice/processes of education related to engineering design.",,,,"Strimel, Greg J. and Bartholomew, Scott R. and Purzer, Senay and Zhang, Liwei and Ruesch, Emily Yoshikawa",10.1080/03043797.2020.1718614,,,14695898,European Journal of Engineering Education,"First year curriculum,adaptive comparative judgment,design projects,engineering design,formative assessment",2,227--246,,Taylor & Francis,{Informing engineering design through adaptive comparative judgment},https://doi.org/10.1080/03043797.2020.1718614,46,2021

article,doi:10.1080/10841806.2015.997630,"This article is about the branch of policy inquiry known as social simulation. As an established technique for inquiring into deterministic systems, simulation allows for important opportunities of discovery. In this article, we discuss the limited opportunities for using simulation to understand and discover in social contexts bound by constitutive rules. In policy inquiry we attempt to understand phenomena that are developed through interlaced rule systems, and we propose that social simulations can be a useful technique for making assumptions explicit and thinking through the logical consequences of rules. We argue that simulation should be viewed as an exercise embedded in what Dewey referred to as the participant theory of knowledge. In such contexts, the goal of the simulation is more committed to understanding than explaining, and learning is achieved through intersubjective reasoning about the construction of the model and the exploration of logical rules made manifest in the actual simulation. As a tool for inquiry, social simulation enhances our ability to think through the procedures that we both construct and expect to witness in the social world, but it is limited in what we can actually determine about the social world.",,,,"Heidelberg, Roy L. and Desai, Anand",10.1080/10841806.2015.997630,,,1084-1806,Administrative Theory & Praxis,,1,1--17,,Routledge,{Simulation Rules: The Role of Simulation in Policy Inquiry},https://doi.org/10.1080/10841806.2015.997630,37,2015

This study used a mental models framework and teacher drawings to examine the practical knowledge of 22 in-service secondary science teachers before and after professional development that was designed to support them to understand and make incremental instructional shifts aligned with the NGSS. Findings indicate that teachers' mental models shifted in two promising ways. First, teachers recognized that their roles and their students' roles would need to change, and second, the doing of science looks and sounds different than what was traditionally done in their classrooms. However, findings also suggest that teachers struggled to reconcile new ideas from the PD with their previous mental models of their classroom practice. These findings are significant because they indicate, teachers may have more fully-formed mental models for what science teaching and learning looks and sounds like when it is focused on what most would traditionally think of as classroom science doing (e.g., “doing labs”), or when it includes traditional knowledge dissemination structures (e.g., lectures).

A case study is presented of the small stateless city-regionalized European nation of the Basque Country through its analytical and transitional lens, locally known as ‘Euskal Hiria' (Basque city-region in the Basque language).

In doing so, this paper suggests how four drivers - metropolitanization, devolution, the right to decide and blockchain - may be respectively invigorating four dynamics - geoeconomics, geopolitics, geodemocratics and geotechnologics - in this transition towards the algorithmic nations.

Sensitivity analysis of agent-based models is computationally demanding, however, and this analysis tends to be intractable for large agent-based modeling. This computational challenge greatly limits our ability to investigate complex spatial dynamics using large agent-based models. The objective of this study is to gain insight into this computational issue by focusing on the sensitivity analysis of large agent-based modeling of spatial opinion exchange, accelerated using multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). We present a heterogeneous parallel computing approach based on nested parallelism for the global sensitivity analysis of the model. The agent-based opinion model is parallelized using many-core GPUs for the simulation of a large number of spatially aware and interacting agents. These agents exchange opinions for developing consensus on topics through processes of spatial neighborhood search and opinion update. Global sensitivity analysis of the opinion model is conducted using a variance-based approach, requiring numerous model runs for Monte Carlo integration. Intermodel parallelization is introduced to enable Monte Carlo runs of sensitivity analysis. We conduct global sensitivity analysis on a multi-GPU cluster. Experimental results indicate GPU-accelerated general-purpose computation provides an efficacious and feasible solution for the sensitivity analysis of large agent-based models.

article,doi:10.1080/14759756.2017.1298233,"Drawing on her experience as “critical interlocutor” within the research project Weaving Codes/Coding Weaves, in this article Emma Cocker reflects on the human qualities of attention, cognitive agility and tactical intelligence activated within live coding and ancient weaving with reference to the Ancient Greek concepts of technē, kairos and m{\^{e}}tis. The article explores how the specificity of “thinking-in-action” cultivated within improvisatory live coding relates to the embodied “thought-in-motion” activated whilst working on the loom. Echoing the wider concerns of Weaving Codes/Coding Weaves, an attempt is made to redefine the relation between weave and code by dislodging the dominant utilitarian histories that connect computer and the loom, instead placing emphasis on the potentially resistant and subversive forms of live thinking-and-knowing cultivated within live coding and ancient weaving. Cocker addresses the Penelopean poetics of both practices, proposing how the combination of kairotic timing and timeliness with the m{\^{e}}tic act of “doing-undoing-redoing” therein offers a subversive alternative to—even critique of—certain utilitarian technological developments (within both coding and weaving) which in privileging efficiency and optimization can delimit creative possibilities, reducing the potential of human intervention and invention in the seizing of opportunity, accident, chance and contingency.",,,,"Cocker, Emma",10.1080/14759756.2017.1298233,,,17518350,Textile: The Journal of Cloth and Culture,"Penelope,kairos,live coding,m{\^{e}}tis,technē,thinking-in-action",2,124--141,,Routledge,{Weaving Codes/Coding Weaves: Penelopean M{\^{e}}tis and the Weaver-Coder's Kairos},https://doi.org/10.1080/14759756.2017.1298233,15,2017

We measured student discourse, student performance, and perceptions of group work. We found that guided prompts were associated with higher-level discourse and higher performance (project scores) than open prompts. Students engaged in guided prompts were more likely to discuss distribution of labour and design/calculation details of their projects than when students responded to open prompts.

The significance of this research for this Special Issue lies in the study's longitudinal nature, which examined students' final-year multimedia productions over a 12-year period (2003–2014) in a university setting. The analysis provides a unique insight into how sociocultural norms, access to technology and institutional forces such as the curriculum and lecturers' subject area of expertise, as well as politics and Ireland's economic recession, have influenced and shaped student voices. It also provides the opportunity to track how the student voice changed and adapted in response to events both inside and outside the university and to identify areas of silence and question what they might mean. The potential for student-produced multimedia to carry gendered qualities, especially regarding audience orientation and media type, is highlighted. Student-produced multimedia artefacts and accompanying written documentation are analysed in terms of genre, media type, audience and purpose, with gender providing a useful overarching framework to further refine the analysis.",,,,"Judge, Miriam and Tuite, Declan",10.1080/17439884.2016.1095764,,,17439892,"Learning, Media and Technology","Irish,digital artefacts,expression,gender,global,local,longitudinal study,new media,qualitative analysis,storytelling",1,28--53,,Routledge,{Leaders or led?

Using the framework of occupational ideology and drawing on qualitative research, this study offers empirical knowledge on the changing constituents of occupational ideology in reference to evaluating a Computational News Discovery tool. The findings add new insights to an emerging trend suggesting that journalists compromise their civic duties in the name of traffic-building and algorithmic judgment. While the results speak to the idiosyncrasy of the case study, they add nuance to the increasing marketisation and technologisation of news production by acknowledging their intensity and the subsequent formalisation of “good performance” over professional judgement.

The goal was to better understand the opportunities for explicit metamodeling talk in the science classroom. The findings revealed the ways in which they used language to frame the modelling work of the classroom. Instances of modelling talk were identified in classroom videos, and coded using a framework for metamodeling knowledge. Findings revealed that, while instances of metamodeling talk were common, they were largely implicit. This shows that the teachers were aware and knowledgeable about metamodeling ideas (e.g. the nature of models, process of modelling, etc.), but often did not make these ideas explicit to their students. Such findings suggest a trend of focusing on models of phenomena rather than supporting student engagement in the epistemic practice of modelling for reasoning about phenomena.

article,doi:10.1080/09500693.2013.791958,"A considerable body of evidence highlights how inquiry-based science can enhance students' epistemic and conceptual understanding of scientific concepts, principles, and theories. However, little is known about how students view themselves as learners of science. In this paper, we explore primary children's images of doing science in school and how they compare themselves with 'real' scientists. Data were collected through the use of a questionnaire, drawing activity, and interviews from 161 Grade 4 (ages 9-10) students in Singapore. Results indicate that 'doing science as conducting hands-on investigations', 'doing science as learning from the teacher', 'doing science as completing the workbook', and 'doing science as a social process' are the images of learning science in school that most of the students held. In addition, students reported that they need to be well behaved first and foremost, while scientists are more likely to work alone and do things that are dangerous. Moreover, students often viewed themselves as 'acting like a scientist' in class, especially when they were doing experiments. Nevertheless, some students reported that they were unlike a scientist because they believed that scientists work alone with dangerous experiments and do not need to listen to the teacher and complete the workbook. These research findings further confirm the earlier argument that young children can make distinctions between school science and 'real' science. This study suggests that the teaching of science as inquiry and by inquiry will shape how students view their classroom experiences and their attitudes towards science. {\textcopyright} 2013 {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor & Francis.",,,,"Zhai, Junqing and Jocz, Jennifer Ann and Tan, Aik Ling",10.1080/09500693.2013.791958,,,14645289,International Journal of Science Education,"Inquiry science,Primary school science,Science student roles,Scientist roles,Student drawing",4,553--576,,Routledge,{'Am I Like a Scientist?': Primary children's images of doing science in school},https://doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2013.791958,36,2014

article,doi:10.1080/20590776.2022.2027212,"Objective: Systems thinking can be counterintuitive to everyday ways of knowing. This can surface doubt around predicted patterns of emergence in complex systems data, especially as it relates to the current climate crisis and related justice-oriented solutions. Method: Our study describes a four-year design-based research project in which we engaged high school biology students in complex systems modelling to understand linkages between increasing ocean temperatures and the rate and severity of disease outbreaks in sea stars. Results: Our findings showed that students approached climate data with uncertainty and viewed their lives as separate from the impacts of climate change. Through iterative design work, youth used authentic data and computational tools to construct geospatial and causal-loop models of climate-related disease outbreaks that situated case studies within broader socioecological and sociotechnical contexts of historic and powered human actions. Through a speculative design lens, models were transformed from data visualization tools to mediums for storying and re-storying present and future worlds for multispecies survival in the face of the climate crisis. Conclusion: Students shifted their understandings of disease outbreaks from a technical perspective to a more social and situated lens of care and responsibility for mitigating the impacts of the climate crisis on human and more-than-human communities. KEY POINTS What is already known about this topic: (1) Teachers that cover climate change often focus solely on technical and data-based aspects during instruction, such as the carbon cycle and increasing atmospheric CO2 levels, without including the social and political contexts through which the climate emergency emerged. (2) Engaging students in meaningful action and problem-solving creates positive affective outcomes and retains hope in students in the face of future climate impacts. (3) There is still more that we need to learn about how to design learning environments that cultivate hope, agency, and multispecies caring in K-12 contexts. What this topic adds: (1) We show how complex systems modelling and data visualization can cultivate multispecies caring and climate action by situating climate-related phenomena in larger socioecological and sociotechnical systems. (2) Through a speculative design lens, we show how modelling can be transformed from data visualization to storytelling and re-storying present and future worlds that centre on ecological and multispecies flourishing. Here we show a new ontological dimension of modelling practices as future and world making. (3) Our research shows how multispecies caring emerged as an action in this world, and for creating the future worlds students wanted to see; it became an affective dimension for making meaning amid the complexity and uncertainty of the climate crisis.",,,,"McGowan, Veronica Cassone and Bell, Philip",10.1080/20590776.2022.2027212,,,20590784,Educational and Developmental Psychologist,"Climate change,complex systems thinking,identity,modelling,science education,speculative design",1,116--131,,Routledge,{“I now deeply care about the effects humans are having on the world”: cultivating ecological care and responsibility through complex systems modelling and investigations},https://doi.org/10.1080/20590776.2022.2027212,39,2022

Many students struggle to progress in fractions in the classrooms and on exams. Teaching strategies are among the most important factors affecting student learning of fractions. The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of virtual and concrete manipulatives for teaching and learning fraction addition and subtraction to fifth-grade students in selected private schools in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. The study employed a quasi-experimental approach in which 81 students (40 male and 41 female) in four groups of grade-five participated in the pretest, intervention, and posttest. The intervention was provided by teaching fraction addition and subtraction by using concrete and virtual manipulatives. Inferential statistics such as Wilcoxon Signed Ranked test, Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal Wallis test were employed. The results indicated that student achievement in learning fractions using concrete manipulatives was better than virtual manipulatives. Also, girls' progress in learning fractions was more significant than boys.

Those schools in wealthier, more populated areas were more likely to use Twitter, with wealthy, suburban schools being the most likely to use it and poor, rural schools being the least likely. Furthermore, factors such as charter school status and urbanity influenced the content of school tweets on key issues, with schools in more populated areas tweeting more about coding and college than schools in less populated areas and charter schools tweeting more about college and the politicized educational issue of common core than non-charters.

Objective: Yet, equity-oriented literature offers limited guidance for developing deep forms of CRC in the classroom. In response, we support the claim that “it takes a village” to develop equity-oriented CS education but additively highlight the roles of cultural experts in the process. Methods: We use a case study methodology to explore one instance of this: a collaboration between a multi-racial team of researchers, a Black cosmetologist, and a White technology teacher. Findings: Three themes supported the CRC collaboration: multi-directional relationship building, iterative engagement with culture-computing, and collaborative implementation of a hybrid lesson. Implications: As opposed to orienting broadening participation around extractive metaphors like “pipelines,” our case study constructs the metaphor of an “open village” to orient CS education toward collaborations between schools and the communities they serve.",,,,"Lachney, Michael and Bennett, Audrey G. and Eglash, Ron and Yadav, Aman and Moudgalya, Sukanya",10.1080/08993408.2021.1874228,,,17445175,Computer Science Education,"Computer science education,broadening participation,culturally responsive computing,it takes a village,racial equity",4,462--488,,Routledge,{Teaching in an open village: a case study on culturally responsive computing in compulsory education},https://doi.org/10.1080/08993408.2021.1874228,31,2021

In turn it has raised the issue of how architects can reduce design complexity using computational techniques. This paper presents a survey on complexity theory inclusive of work from the disciplines which range from cybernetics to systems and information theory. We synthesize a taxonomy of different definitions of complexity and ways of managing design complexity by decomposing its different levels as they relate to the fields of architecture, engineering and construction. Our hypothesis is that by reviewing the literature on complexity theory which appears to be highly fragmented, we can aid designers build a better understanding of the underlying principles. Thus designers can develop a more system approach towards the use of digital design tools and make use of concepts coming from the field of complexity theory such as abstraction, adaptation and self-organization in order to come up with novel computational design methods. Such methods can enable designers to deal with design problems holistically and manage design complexity in the contemporary digital design context.",,,,"Pantazis, Evangelos and Gerber, David Jason",10.1080/00038628.2019.1659750,,,17589622,Architectural Science Review,"Complexity theory,complex adaptive systems,computational design,design complexity,holistic design",5,371--388,,Taylor & Francis,{Beyond geometric complexity: a critical review of complexity theory and how it relates to architecture engineering and construction},https://doi.org/10.1080/00038628.2019.1659750,62,2019

To achieve this goal, it is necessary to have a set of observable and measurable indicators of the behavioral practices of computer application users. Accordingly, a psycho-computing traits scale was developed that extracts six main dimensions of the behavioral practices of computer users and computer science students. To ensure the validity and reliability of the scale, it was applied to a survey sample of 150 students. Subsequently, the final version of the scale was applied to an experimental sample of 722 students to verify its psychometric properties. The results of the study indicate that the psycho-computing traits scale exhibits sound psychometric properties in terms of construct validity, as evidenced by the results of the Rasch model assumptions for the data obtained from its application. Moreover, the confirmatory factor analysis results demonstrate that the goodness of fit indicators align with the main dimensions of the scale.

article,doi:10.1080/02635143.2019.1682988,"Background: To support a paradigm shift for 21st century learning, teacher design work is emphasized by conceptualizing teachers as designers. Despite the fact that teaching is increasingly referred to as a design science, both teacher educators and curriculum developers know little about how to enhance teacher design work in technology-enhanced learning environments. Further, teachers' design knowledge, design experience and supports available to them are not articulated in a systematic manner. Purpose & Method: To address these issues, this study reports a systematic review of the literature on the design work of teachers within technology-enhanced learning environments, in STEM domains. In this review, there are four main themes: the context where teachers' design work takes place, the form that the design work took, the aspect/phase of design process that the paper focuses on, and details of any supports that assist teachers in the work of design. Findings: Teacher design work takes place in a variety of contexts, and teacher design work also takes many forms. Research that reports on design work tends to focus on the implementation and evaluation components of the design process. Teachers have access to a variety of supports, including design materials and design frameworks. Conclusions: This synthesis identifies future areas of research in supporting STEM teachers' design knowledge.",,,,"Kim, Mi Song",10.1080/02635143.2019.1682988,,,14701138,Research in Science and Technological Education,"Teacher design work,a systematic review,teacher design knowledge (TDK),teachers-as-designers,technology-enhanced learning environments",2,131--155,,Routledge,{A systematic review of the design work of STEM teachers},https://doi.org/10.1080/02635143.2019.1682988,39,2021
article,doi:10.1080/10508406.2018.1468259,"Designers who create computer-based learning experiences for places like museums, out-of-school programs, and homes face a number of challenges related to the informal nature of such settings. Designs must generally function on their own without the support of teachers or curriculum while at the same time engaging a diverse audience, supporting productive social interaction, and activating appropriate prior knowledge and skills. In this article, I present an approach to the design of informal learning experiences based on tangible interaction. The term tangible refers to a variety of human–computer interaction techniques that move beyond computer screens and create opportunities for people to interact with digital systems using their bodies and physical artifacts. I argue that tangible interaction creates unique opportunities for designers to shape objects and situations to evoke cultural forms of literacy, learning, and play. In particular, I propose a class of cultural forms called cueing forms that can invite participation into patterned social activity while cueing cognitive, physical, and emotional resources on the part of individuals. To illustrate these arguments, I describe 3 design cases that colleagues and I have created to support learning in museums and homes.",,,,"Horn, Michael S.",10.1080/10508406.2018.1468259,,,10508406,Journal of the Learning Sciences,,4,632--665,,Routledge,{Tangible Interaction and Cultural Forms: Supporting Learning in Informal Environments},https://doi.org/10.1080/10508406.2018.1468259,27,2018

In addition to the potential for fostering EE, the integration of EE and NGSS may provide a unique set of conditions for understanding how and why teachers shift their practice to incorporate more EE in their classrooms. Using a mixed methodology research design, this study examines the outcomes and processes of a professional development institute that integrated NGSS and student-driven environmental stewardship. This study provides evidence that integrating NGSS Science and Engineering Practices with stewardship may help infuse EE into classrooms. The research also contributes to theoretical understanding of the processes by which professional development shapes teacher change within an organizational context. Specifically, teacher instructional change was predicated on a shift in their beliefs that stewardship was possible in a standards and accountability-based educational context. The requisite shift in beliefs came about through the expectations and supportive resources provided by the professional development, teacher observation of student engagement, and the justification NGSS integration provided for stewardship activities.",,,,"Hayes, Kathryn N. and Wheaton, Mele and Tucker, Deborah",10.1080/13504622.2017.1396289,,,14695871,Environmental Education Research,"Science education,professional development,stewardship,teacher instructional change",1,115--134,,Routledge,{Understanding teacher instructional change: the case of integrating NGSS and stewardship in professional development},https://doi.org/10.1080/13504622.2017.1396289,25,2019

Objective: The first objective is to lay out a theoretical foundation for understanding the learning situation when novices first encounter programming in the computer lab. The second objective is to illustrate how this theoretical foundation can help give insight by applying it to an empirical study. Method: Core concepts from Dewey's pragmatic theory are combined with the thinking of Deleuze and the later Wittgenstein to form a theoretical framework. The main empirical data is seven student interviews, which were analyzed using a qualitative content analysis method in two steps, first analyzing the stated content and second through the lens of the theoretical framework. Findings: Students' learning processes can be understood as ‘come to agreement' and habitual actions when doing programming as ‘practical thinking'. Implications: Programming education can be reframed beyond the theory–practice dichotomy already rejected by pragmatism.

It presents a new challenge to teachers as it signals an opportunity to shift from a teacher-centred to a student-centred approach in practical inquiry. The research study adopted a mixed methodology research design that involved the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative data were collected by means of questionnaires that were administered to 55 teachers. Qualitative data were collected by means of five classroom observations of student investigations and in-depth teacher interviews. The analysis of all the data revealed that teachers believe in providing support and not allowing learners to discover for themselves when participating in investigations.

Given the predictive power of this construct, this study explores Thai students' STEM identities by focussing on three components (i.e. interest, performance, and recognition) in light of their gender, educational programme, and career aspiration. One hundred and thirty-one students in Grades 10–11 from two secondary schools participated in the study. A Likert-type questionnaire was employed to gather data, which were subsequently transformed into interval scores using Rasch analysis. Inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. This study reveals that male and female students do not significantly differ in terms of their interest in and recognition of STEM. However, gender differences manifest regarding performance in STEM. Those studying in STEM-focussed programmes are likely to show stronger STEM identities than those in non-STEM programmes.

article,Liu2023,"Programming self-efficacy plays an important role in promoting interest in programming education among teenagers. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine to what extent family socioeconomic status, programming learning, programming teaching, and gender influence programming self-efficacy. A total of 851 upper-secondary-school students were surveyed using the Programming Self-Efficacy Scale, Family Socioeconomic Questionnaire, Programming Teaching Scale and Programming Learning Scale. Correlation analysis showed that programming learning, gender, family socioeconomic status, and programming self-efficacy were significantly correlated. As well, t-test results indicated that programming learning, gender, and family socioeconomic status were the key factors influencing programming self-efficacy. Furthermore, programming learning and gender were significant predictors of programming self-efficacy. Besides, the results of the interviews with 10 students also indicated that several of the above factors would have an impact on programming self-efficacy. Thus, this study provides an empirical basis for changing from “teaching-centred” to “learning-centred” programming for teenagers and inspires teachers to take into account learner attitudes, learning methods and gender differences in the design and delivery of programming education. In addition, the results underline the positive influence of family-related factors on teenager learning programming needs to be fully exploited in order to promote programming education among teenagers.",,,,"Liu, Jun and Li, Qingyue and Sun, Xue and Zhu, Ziqi and Xu, Yanhua",10.1080/02188791.2021.1985430,,,17426855,Asia Pacific Journal of Education,"China,Programming education,programming self-efficacy",3,835--849,,Routledge,{Factors influencing programming self-efficacy: an empirical study in the context of Mainland China},https://doi.org/10.1080/02188791.2021.1985430,43,2023

article,doi:10.1080/02635143.2020.1761783,"Background: Dataset skills are used in STEM fields from astronomy to zoology. Few fields explicitly teach students the skills to analyze datasets, and yet the increasing push for authentic science implies these skills should be taught. Purpose: The overarching motivation of this work is to understand authentic science learning of STEM dataset skills within an astronomy context. Specifically, when participants work with a 200-entry Google Sheets dataset of astronomical data, what are they learning, how are they learning it, and who is doing the learning? Sample: The authors studied a total of 82 post-secondary participants, including a matched set of 54 pre/post-test (34 males, 18 females), 26 video recorded (22 males, 2 females), and 3 interviewed (2 males, 1 female) participants. Design and methods: In this mixed-methods study, participants explored a three-phase dataset activity and were given an eight-question multiple-choice pre/post-test covering skills of analyzing datasets and astronomy content, with the cognitive load of questions spanning from recognition of terms through synthesizing multiple ideas. Pre/post-test scores were compared and ANOVA performed for subsamples by gender. Select examples of qualitative data are shown, including written answers to questions, video recordings, and interviews. Results: This project expands existing literature on authentic science experiences into the domain of dataset education in astronomy. Participants exhibited learning in both recall and synthesis questions. Females exhibited lower levels of learning than males which could be connected to gender influence. Conversations of both males and females included gendered topics. Conclusions: Implications of the study include a stronger dataset focus in post-secondary STEM education, and the need for further investigation into how instructors can ameliorate the challenges faced by female post-secondary students.",,,,"Schwortz, Andria C. and Burrows, Andrea C.",10.1080/02635143.2020.1761783,,,14701138,Research in Science and Technological Education,"Dataset,STEM education,authentic science experiences,gender,post-secondary student learning",3,347--367,,Routledge,{Authentic science experiences with STEM datasets: post-secondary results and potential gender influences},https://doi.org/10.1080/02635143.2020.1761783,39,2021

article,doi:10.1080/08993408.2022.2134677,"Background and Context: Differences in children's and adolescents' initial attitudes about computing and other STEM fields may form during middle school and shape decisions leading to career entry. Early emerging differences in career interest may propagate a lack of diversity in computer science and programming fields. Objective: Though middle school is recognized as a formative period in the development of career interest, there appears to be a gap in research considering growth disparities in students' attitudes towards computer programming. We examine outcomes related to students' use of an e-learning platform designed to promote exposure to computer science content. We consider growth in middle school students' attitudes towards computer programming during an academic year while controlling for variation in key baseline factors. Method: We tracked growth in attitudes towards computer programming among middle school students (N = 610; Mage = 12.07) in schools serving underrepresented minority (URM) students (74.7% URM) during an academic year in which they used an online platform curating computer programming educational content. Findings: We found baseline differences in students' interest and aspirations toward computer programming on the basis of gender and underrepresented status, after controlling for math attitudes. There was evidence of initial growth in all four domains of computer programming attitudes, irrespective of gender or underrepresented status. Implications: These findings provide a framework for studying changes in students' computer programming attitudes, which may help in addressing workforce participation disparities. Future work is needed to promote early computer programming attitudes among all students.",,,,"Ober, Teresa M. and Cheng, Ying and Coggins, Meghan R. and Brenner, Paul and Zdankus, Janice and Gonsalves, Philip and Johnson, Emmanuel and Urdan, Tim",10.1080/08993408.2022.2134677,,,17445175,Computer Science Education,"Computer science education,STEM attitudes,STEM education,STEM workforce diversity,growth model,middle school",1,4--36,,Routledge,{Charting a path for growth in middle school students' attitudes toward computer programming},https://doi.org/10.1080/08993408.2022.2134677,34,2024

Systems biology is focused on understanding living things as a function of their various interactions at multiple levels: not simply as a sum of all their individual parts at any one level. This integrative approach yields predictive models of the normal state, the disease state and therapeutic actions. Although molecular biology has collected an enormous amount of information, including the sequencing of the entire human genome in the year 2000, few real-world applications have resulted from this molecular approach. The pharmaceutical industry's R&D expenditure has increased substantially since 2000, but the number of approved therapeutics has dropped simultaneously, due in part to over-reliance on reductionist genomic, and not systems, approaches. Instead of using reductionist genomics approaches alone, genomics should be incorporated into a multi-level systems biology approach to develop diagnostics and therapeutics. {\textcopyright} 2013 Informa UK Ltd.",PMID: 24138553,,,"Maguire, Greg",10.1586/14737159.2013.846828,,,14737159,Expert Review of Molecular Diagnostics,"epigenetics,genomic variability,molecular biology,multifactorial,reductionism,systems biology,systems diagnostic,transposons",8,895--905,24138553,Taylor & Francis,{Using a systems-based approach to overcome reductionist strategies in the development of diagnostics},https://doi.org/10.1586/14737159.2013.846828,13,2013

The research questions guide an exploration of technological applications, the impact on learning outcomes, engagement, and challenges faced by educators in Indonesia, culminating in proposed policy recommendations. The methodology of this qualitative study is based on a systematic literature review, utilizing the PRISMA framework to ensure a thorough and reproducible analysis of the existing scholarly works from Scopus and Web of Science databases. The search, employing keywords related to technology in the Indonesian mathematics curriculum, resulted in a dataset of 60 papers from Scopus and 11 from Web of Science, with a focus on empirical studies published exclusively in English. After applying further limitations and eliminating duplicates, a final set of 36 articles was selected for comprehensive analysis. The results show the diverse landscape of technology integration in mathematics education, identifying four primary classifications: hardware, general software, mathematical software, and online resources. Notably, general software, especially PowerPoint, emerges as a predominant tool, while positive outcomes, including improved learning, enhanced problem-solving skills, and increased comprehension, highlight the overall benefits of technology integration. However, challenges such as issues with mobile devices and limited digital tools underscore the need for strategic efforts to address infrastructure limitations.

Sample: This study examined a clustered sample of 2949 Finnish students in the final year of comprehensive school (15–16 years old). Methods: Through explorative factor analysis, we extracted several variables that were expected to influence student intention to enrol in physics courses. We applied partial correlation to determine the underlying interdependencies of the variables. Results: The analysis revealed that the main predictor of enrolment in upper secondary school physics courses is whether students feel that physics is important. Although statistically significant, partial correlations between variables were rather small. However, the analysis of partial correlations revealed that pedagogical practices influence inquiry and attitudinal factors. Pedagogical practices that emphasise science experimentation and the social construction of knowledge had the strongest influence.

Introduced is a theoretical notion of ‘place-making' which frames how different depths, patterns and modes of learning engagement emerge from the activity system of personal, material and social affordances. It is argued that fostering engagement and cocreating knowledge practices hinge upon increasing awareness of how these nested affordances interrelate with one another. The proposed ‘place-making framework' has implications for how activity systems of learning, teaching, assessment and research can be integrated meaningfully within pedagogy for the networked age.",,,,"Swist, Teresa and Kuswara, Andreas",10.1080/07294360.2015.1128887,,,14698366,Higher Education Research and Development,"Activity system,Affordances,Digital technologies,Engagement,Knowledge practices,Learning,Placemaking",1,100--114,,Routledge,{Place-making in higher education: Co-creating engagement and knowledge practices in the networked age},https://doi.org/10.1080/07294360.2015.1128887,35,2016

Design and Methods: In this paper, we use a particular characterisation of NOS based on the Family Resemblance Approach (FRA) to investigate the cognitive-epistemic aspects of NOS in the science textbooks aimed at vocational education in Norway. The cognitive-epistemic aspects are about the aims and values, methods, practices, and knowledge in science. Three key textbooks have been selected and analysed with a focus on end-of-chapter tasks.

Writing in this manner fails to recognize how the societal and internalized ideas of white dominance can negatively influence how Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) understand academic writing. Challenging this limited view of academic writing is essential; otherwise, rising BIPOC scholars may learn to withhold their voices and lived experiences from their writing. Pedagogical approaches that equip emerging BIPOC scholars to find and cultivate their academic writing identities are vital to nurturing their sense of agency. This article explores what these approaches may look like by centering the experiences of two BIPOC graduate students in an academic writing class and reflecting on their evolution as scholarly writers. Characteristics of the course are critically analyzed to identify how the reflective component of the course contributed to these students' perceptions of what scholarship entails and how valuable their contributions are to academia.

article,Buber2020,"The purpose of this paper is to present an activity based on the integration of modeling and STEM to answer a real-life question related to volcanism which is a continuously unobservable but important phenomenon for many countries. For this purpose, firstly an activity was developed about volcanic eruptions to model the characteristics of volcanic eruptions' explosiveness. Afterwards, the participants designed a predictor of a possible eruption by using an engineering design process. The study was conducted in a public university in Turkey with twenty-four 3rd grade Pre-Service Science Teachers (PSSTs) in three weeks. In the first week, the real-life scenario was given to the PSSTs and they modeled the characteristics of volcanic eruptions' explosiveness such as viscosity, pressure, and rate of degassing. Followingly, they planned their predictors of volcanic eruptions based on what they learned in the modeling stage and started to design in the second week. In the third week, they completed their prototypes and shared their prototype development experiences with classmates. Many prototypes were presented as examples in which they used detecting the gas released from a volcano, measuring changes in the shape of the volcano, as well as monitoring earthquakes that may signal a possible eruption.",,,,"Buber, Ayse and {Unal Coban}, Gul",10.1080/00368121.2020.1814193,,,0036-8121,Science Activities,,3,111--121,,Routledge,{From modeling to STEM: a predictor activity of volcanic eruption},https://doi.org/10.1080/00368121.2020.1814193,57,2020

article,Priemer2020,"Background: Recent developments in STEM and computer science education put a strong emphasis on twenty-first-century skills, such as solving authentic problems. These skills typically transcend single disciplines. Thus, problem-solving must be seen as a multidisciplinary challenge, and the corresponding practices and processes need to be described using an integrated framework. Purpose: We present a fine-grained, integrated, and interdisciplinary framework of problem-solving for education in STEM and computer science by cumulatively including ways of problem-solving from all of these domains. Thus, the framework serves as a tool box with a variety of options that are described by steps and processes for students to choose from. The framework can be used to develop competences in problem-solving. Sources of evidence: The framework was developed on the basis of a literature review. We included all prominent ways of domain-specific problem-solving in STEM and computer science, consisting mainly of empirically orientated approaches, such as inquiry in science, and solely theory-orientated approaches, such as proofs in mathematics. Main argument: Since there is an increasing demand for integrated STEM and computer science education when working on natural phenomena and authentic problems, a problem-solving framework exclusively covering the natural sciences or other single domains falls short. Conclusions: Our framework can support both practice and research by providing a common background that relates the ways, steps, processes, and activities of problem-solving in the different domains to one single common reference. In doing so, it can support teachers in explaining the multiple ways in which science problems can be solved and in constructing problems that reflect these numerous ways. STEM and computer science educational research can use the framework to develop competences of problem-solving at a fine-grained level, to construct corresponding assessment tools, and to investigate under what conditions learning progressions can be achieved.",,,,"Priemer, Burkhard and Eilerts, Katja and Filler, Andreas and Pinkwart, Niels and R{\""{o}}sken-Winter, Bettina and Tiemann, R{\""{u}}diger and {Zu Belzen}, Annette Upmeier",10.1080/02635143.2019.1600490,,,14701138,Research in Science and Technological Education,"Problem-solving,STEM education,computer science education,inquiry",1,105--130,,Routledge,{A framework to foster problem-solving in STEM and computing education},https://doi.org/10.1080/02635143.2019.1600490,38,2020

article,Bielik2022,"To meet the demands of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), teachers need to reconsider their current instructional practices, shifting from learning about scientific ideas to making sense of phenomena and solving problems using three-dimensional learning components. Project-Based Learning (PBL) provides a framework for creating NGSS-aligned curricular materials that supports this shift. In this study, high school chemistry and physics teachers collaborated with science education researchers to develop PBL-aligned units that were later enacted in their classrooms. Results found several emerging concepts regarding shifting toward PBL: (i) the units helped students build toward the NGSS 3-dimensional learning goals, (ii) using the driving questions was important in providing lessons with coherence and relevance, (iii) students were meaningfully using scientific practices, mostly the practice of developing and using scientific modeling, (iv) students collaborated and shared ideas to make sense of phenomena, and (v) students' artifacts contributed to their learning and to the assessment of their learning by the teachers. Teachers reported encountering several challenges when shifting to PBL, mostly for those of which it was their first interaction with the PBL approach and the NGSS. These ideas were further supported with students' data, obtained from real-time reports, indicating students' increased engagement in the modeling practice and increased opportunities to collaborate and share ideas with other students during most of the PBL units. This study demonstrates that engaging teachers and students with PBL curricula can support successful integration of the NGSS learning goals, as perceived by the teachers and reported by students.",,,,"Bielik, Tom and Finnie, Kellie and Peek-Brown, Deborah and Klager, Chris and Touitou, Israel and Schneider, Barbara and Krajcik, Joseph",10.1080/1046560X.2021.1961973,,,15731847,Journal of Science Teacher Education,"Project Based Learning,curricular materials,teacher perspectives",4,413--434,,Routledge,{High School Teachers' Perspectives on Shifting towards Teaching NGSS-Aligned Project Based Learning Curricular Units},https://doi.org/10.1080/1046560X.2021.1961973,33,2022
article,Gouseti2023,"Digital systems are increasingly becoming central to the running of contemporary schools. A range of digital tools are also adopted by teachers to facilitate face to face teaching and learning and more recently to accommodate remote schooling. Similarly, digital technologies lie at the heart of how students support their learning but also interact with peers. These digital practices raise questions in relation to teachers' own critical digital literacies as well as their role in developing students' critical digital literacies. This paper presents the findings of a qualitative study that aimed to develop an understanding of teachers' current experiences and future needs relating to critical digital literacies within school contexts. Drawing on empirical data collected during focus group interviews with primary and secondary school teachers in Finland, Italy, Spain and the UK this paper looks at teachers' perceptions of critical digital literacies and explores whether and how these are manifested in their practices. Findings revealed that different dimensions of critical digital literacies were more prevalent for each national group and highlighted the disjuncture between how Critical digital literacies (CDL) is defined and perceived in academic research with a stronger emphasis on the “critical” and between the more “twenty-first century skills” oriented policy agendas and curricula which inform teachers' practice.

article,Falkner2012,"Contributing student pedagogy (CSP) builds upon social constructivist and community-based learning principles to create engaging and productive learning experiences. What makes CSP different from other, related, learning approaches is that it involves students both learning from and also explicitly valuing the contributions of other students. The creation of such a learning community builds upon established educational psychology that encourages deep learning, reflection and engagement. Our school has recently completed a review and update of its curriculum, incorporating student content-creation and collaboration into the design of key courses across the curriculum. Our experiences, based on several years of experimentation and development, support CSP-based curriculum design to reinforce the value of the student perspective, the clear description of their own transformative pathway to knowledge and the importance of establishing student-to-student networks in which students are active and willing participants. In this paper, we discuss the tools and approaches that we have employed to guide, support and structure student collaboration across a range of courses and year levels.

article,Garcia2023,"Background and Context: Despite the growing initiatives in K-12 computer science (CS), there is a continued disparity in the participation of Latinx and multilingual students, a historically underrepresented group in computing. The inequitable participation may be understood by examining students' early development of CS attitudes. Objective: This study aims to explore shifts and elicitation in coding attitudes of fourth-grade, Latinx students (ages 9-10) who underwent a year-long remote coding curriculum, with consideration of gender and language designation. Method: Using a mixed method approach, pre-post survey responses on coding attitudes were analyzed to understand shifts and portrayal of Interest, Confidence, Utility, Social Values, and Perception of Coders, with consideration of gender or designation as an English Language Learner. Findings: Gender and language designation did not interact with overall attitude shifts. However, there is a significant difference in Social Values and Confidence over time. Student interviews revealed more nuance in social influences with siblings and cousins as key motivators for extended learning, underlying values of perseverance in confidence, mixed perception of what coders do, and the importance of creativity to develop interest. Implications: The key role of social influence in driving higher identity among Latinx students points to the important role of extended family. Moreso, developing students' confidence in domain-specific tasks should be a focus in curricula in order to have a longer-term impact on motivation. Finally, more research on the role that subjective task values pertaining to cultural values should be explored in early coding motivation in order to broaden participation.

Debates about computing education have closely followed job markets, technological development, academic interests, societal concerns, and changes in the perception of computing. The themes in computing education debates can be characterized by emergence and formation, standardization and organization, accommodation to change, and divergence. The focus of computing education has expanded outward from the computer to programming, algorithms, and information, as well as to the organizational, social, and cultural environment of computer systems. This survey gives computing education researchers an overview of some of the central issues and disputes in computing education over the brief history of modern computing. The survey highlights the emergence of educational initiatives, concepts, joint efforts, and institutions of computing education, and outlines the relatively short history of computing education research. The survey is structured around four overlapping themes: computing education as technological training, as training for software development, as a central element for the field's academic recognition, and as training for computational problem-solving in any domain of knowledge.

However, these materials rarely promote the use of research-based practices to effectively scaffold from documented authentic historical episodes of physics research to physics and the nature of science (NOS) concepts. Such practices that invoke a conceptual change approach are a crucial component of inquiry experiences that deepen students' understanding of science concepts and the NOS.

article,Bofylatos2016,"The aim of this paper is to describe and discuss a proposed framework that enables and encourages a robust communication context for the design process. Sustainability can be seen as a wicked problem, therefore creating, maintaining and managing a consensus during the design process is a necessary requirement. Consequently, dialogue is central to this. The framework proposes the use of four different layers of abstraction of information in order to facilitate the creation of shared meaning through dialogue. The four levels selected for this model are: the meaning level, the semantic level, the syntactic level and the artefact level. Communication modalities and the types of concepts are different at each level. The necessity for this framework stems from the wide range of emerging approaches to design and their myriad connections to the notion of sustainability. The proposed framework fosters the creation of a platform that allows exchange, evolution and synthesis.",,,,"Bofylatos, Spyros and Spyrou, Thomas",10.1080/14606925.2016.1130405,,,14606925,Design Journal,"communication,design dialogue,emergence,meaning,reflection",2,269--282,,Routledge,{Supporting Design Dialogue through a Communication Framework Using Four Layers of Abstraction},https://doi.org/10.1080/14606925.2016.1130405,19,2016
article,Olsson2021,"This essay describes and investigates representations and figurations of ‘posthuman ecologies' in contemporary poetry, i.e., how non-human agencies and materialities are evoked and explored in poetic writing, and how this is accompanied by a problematisation of anthropocentrism and certain strands of humanism. Specific attention is paid to shifts in scale and ‘intermediations' between, for instance, bacteria and humans. The emergence and analysis of such ecologies are connected to a history of ‘cyberneticization' and ‘ecologization' manifested both in digital media, techno- and bio-capitalism, and in a rejuvenation of the concept of ecology in contemporary thinking. In this essay, these issues are discussed in relation to three recent poetic works by Adam Dickinson, J. R. Carpenter, and Nasser Hussain.

article,Lovric2018,"We discuss teaching and learning situations that surfaced when computer programming and mathematics were brought together in a course where students write computer code to explore mathematics problems. Combining programming and mathematics creates a rich ecosystem which, on top of traditional mathematics activities (writing solutions, proofs, etc.), offers simulation and experimentation, invites discussions about structure, requires logic and testing strategies, and handles mathematics objects with an added feeling of reality. Focusing on novice and inexperienced programmers, we look for answers to the practice-oriented question, “How do students reason through their difficulties when using programming to explore a mathematics problem?” Following literature review and methodology, we build the programming model, which we use to study students' experiences as they approach a mathematical problem by writing computer code. Our research is based on analyzing students' in-class work and class notes, author's observations of students working on their computers, and his interactions with students in class and elsewhere.

article,Leroy2023,"Idea generation in interactive learning environments requires the consideration of the interactivity and materiality aspects of creativity. In educational robotics, idea generation is mediated through a technological object in a process allowing us to observe the three main components of divergent thinking: fluency, flexibility, and originality. Nevertheless, divergent thinking assessment has been mainly evaluated in the last decades through semantic idea generation tasks such the Alternative Uses Test (AUT), asking participants to write different uses for familiar objects. In our study, we aimed to analyze differences in the three divergent thinking components (fluency, flexibility, and originality) through the AUT as a semantic task and through an educational robotic task that engaged the participants in building their ideas interactively. Results show that the creative components are strongly correlated within but not between the two tasks, leading us to consider the differences in the creative processes engaged when generating ideas through building with robotic objects.

article,Pedwell2024,"In the wake of Turing's ‘universal machine', this article foregrounds intuition as a generative concept and lens to unfold the affective genealogies of human-machine relations in post-war transatlantic cultures. As a mode of sensing, knowing, anticipating, and navigating the world that exceeds rational analysis, intuition is, I will argue, vital to attuning to our contemporary ‘algorithmic condition', in which machine learning technologies are actively re-distributing cognition across humans and machines, transforming the nature of (in)human experience, and rearticulating questions of cultural value and desire. The article focuses on three key historical moments which enable us to retrospectively glimpse an emerging condensation of interest and urgency concerning our changing relationships with ‘new' technologies in Britain and North America–1) 1950s: The birth of AI and cybernetics; 2) 1980s: The rise of the personal computer and software cultures and; 3) 2010s: Inhabiting algorithmic life. In each period, particular aspects of intuition surface as significant in animating our affective and cultural entanglements with computational technologies. While intuition has gained affective traction at particular historical junctures as both what essentially defines ‘the human' and what has become essentially inhuman, I argue that addressing the sensorial, socio-political, cultural, and ethical issues current machine learning architectures open up requires attuning to immanent human-algorithmic entanglements and the techno-social ecologies they inhabit and recursively reshape.",,,,"Pedwell, Carolyn",10.1080/09502386.2022.2142805,,,14664348,Cultural Studies,"Affect,Alan Turing,algorithm,cybernetics,intuition,post-war genealogy",2,188--218,,Routledge,{Speculative machines and us: more-than-human intuition and the algorithmic condition},https://doi.org/10.1080/09502386.2022.2142805,38,2024

article,Kapucu2017,"This study explores finding the areas of polygons with a smartphone light sensor. A square and an irregular pentagon were chosen as our polygons. During the activity, the LED light was placed at the vertices of our polygons, and the illuminance values of this LED light were detected by the smartphone light sensor. The smartphone was placed on a rotating time-lapse device, and this device was placed at the intersection point of the line segments in the polygons. These line segments were also connected to the vertices of these polygons; therefore, the square was composed of four triangles and the pentagon of five triangles. While the rotating time-lapse device was rotating around itself, it captured the maximum illuminance values of the LED light. Using these maximum illuminance values, we calculated the lengths of the line segments. In addition, we knew the period of the rotating time-lapse device and the duration elapsed between two consecutive maximum illuminance values. Thus, we could calculate the angle between two consecutive line segments. With these values, we could also calculate the areas of the triangles in the polygons. Then, the areas of these triangles were summed to obtain the areas of the square and pentagon.

Results showed that no significant difference was found in the students' learning attitude, programming skills, and learning engagement between VPR and PR, while significant difference existed in engineering design ability and cognitive load, no matter in simple or complex learning sessions. Although the VPR strategy is not always better than the PR one, it has unique advantages on facilitating students' higher-order thinking in solving complex problem, as well as reducing their cognitive load.

article,Karasinski2016,"Background and Aims: Each academic subject requires a specific set of language skills, termed disciplinary literacy, for mastery. Educational reforms in the United States have focused on the need to integrate teaching of language concepts within the core academic subjects. Science educators recognize the need to teach science literacy within the science curriculum. Despite the acknowledgement of the role of language in science mastery, few studies have empirically investigated the relation between science and language ability. This investigation assessed the contribution of written language ability to performance on a science achievement measure. Methods and Procedures: The current investigation analyzed data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class eighth-grade wave (N = 8928). Students completed individual direct paper-and-pencil testing in science and written language. Results: Student scores on evaluating non-fiction, evaluating complex syntax, and evaluating narratives were entered hierarchically into a linear regression model as predictors of scores on the science test. All three were significant predictors, and together accounted for 59% of the variance in science test scores. Discussion: The results of this investigation highlight the role of language ability in science achievement. Collaboration between speech-language pathologists and science teachers is warranted to facilitate maximal outcomes in science mastery for adolescents.",,,,"Karasinski, Courtney",10.1080/2050571X.2016.1187465,,,20505728,"Speech, Language and Hearing","Disciplinary literacy,Reading comprehension,Science education",4,203--210,,Taylor & Francis,"{Comprehension of narratives, non-fiction, and complex syntax as predictors of science achievement}",https://doi.org/10.1080/2050571X.2016.1187465,19,2016
article,Sapounidis2024,"Educational Robotics (ER) and Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) have entered schools and are parts of formal and informal education. Consequently, a wide range of relevant activities and interventions, from kindergarten to high school, are carried out emphasizing their potential benefits, in relation to traditional curriculum, while skepticism also appears among researchers and specialists. To highlight issues on this matter, this paper presents a lucid and systematic literature review exploring the effects and characteristics of ER research. In this work, 21 empirical articles out of 808 records from 8 databases were employed. The main features of the articles, such as research design, sample size, intervention objectives, equipment type, and activities, were recorded and elaborated to understand the types and the significance of inquiries conducted in the field. In addition, 57 studies involving 10,913 participants, which emerged from the review search, were subjected to a meta-analysis and investigated the effects of ER and STEM use on students' knowledge, skills, and attitudes. The finding showed that most of the related studies are non-experimental with limited duration, and more effort is needed to apply these technologies in less traditional domains like language learning or history. The meta-analysis showed that ER and STEM have a positive impact on knowledge, skills, and attitudes, while students' skills proved to have benefited the most from the use of these technologies.",,,,"Sapounidis, Theodosios and Tselegkaridis, Sokratis and Stamovlasis, Dimitrios",10.1080/15391523.2022.2160394,,,19450818,Journal of Research on Technology in Education,"Primary education,educational robotics,meta-analysis,systematic literature review",4,462--476,,Routledge,{Educational robotics and STEM in primary education: a review and a meta-analysis},https://doi.org/10.1080/15391523.2022.2160394,56,2024
article,Alterator2018,"Given current extensive expectations of how teachers should excel, any attempt to summarize teacher expertise in action in the second decade of this century may seem at best misguided. However, this has not stopped teacher educators offering diverse metaphoric encapsulations that aim both to distil and prescribe quality teacher practice. In this paper, we attempt to make sense of this diversity, and contribute to a richer dialog about this expertise. We draw on Anna Sfard's influential metaphoric map of competing views of learning as a starting point. We claim that this metaphoric divide is evident in current divergent theories of desirable teaching practices and their metaphoric badging, although there is evidence in current curricular documents of attempts to acknowledge and engage with these accounts. In analyzing these metaphors and their warrants, in a context of intensified accountability, rapid changes to technological affordances, and divided views about how student agency should serve learning processes, we aim to tease out core issues. We draw on recent curricular and policy prescriptions about teacher expertise in the Australian context to illustrate our case.

article,Ward2016,"ABSTRACT: Air Toxics Under the Big Sky is an environmental science outreach/education program that incorporates the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) 8 Practices with the goal of promoting knowledge and understanding of authentic scientific research in high school classrooms through air quality research. This research explored: (1) how the program affects student understanding of scientific inquiry and research and (2) how the open-inquiry learning opportunities provided by the program increase student interest in science as a career path. Treatment students received instruction related to air pollution (airborne particulate matter), associated health concerns, and training on how to operate air quality testing equipment. They then participated in a yearlong scientific research project in which they developed and tested hypotheses through research of their own design regarding the sources and concentrations of air pollution in their homes and communities. Results from an external evaluation revealed that treatment students developed a deeper understanding of scientific research than did comparison students, as measured by their ability to generate good hypotheses and research designs, and equally expressed an increased interest in pursuing a career in science.

article,Wang2024,"Objective: The goal of the present study was to determine whether using gamification with the flexibility of board game design to prepare aviation cadets for future flight training could reduce their fatigue and stress from work overload and thereby decrease risk of human error leading to accidents. Background: Cadets need to have fully acquired aviation knowledge so as be able to access it spontaneously in decision-making when operating an aircraft and performing multi-tasks. The current tight training schedule and the need to immediately apply newly learned knowledge add considerable stress to the fatigue resulting from highly demanding physical training. Method: A board game involving specific content, rules, and contexts and incorporating competition and collaboration was designed. Results: The results showed that the learning effect of the game group was at least the same as, if not better than, traditional self-study. Both groups of cadets could retrieve their learning after two months. The game group was significantly more positive in their responses to the flow survey and expressed being in favor of learning by playing board games in the interviews. Conclusion: The findings suggest the feasibility of adjusting the current pilot training program by adopting game-based learning of aviation knowledge at an early stage for future use.",,,,"Wang, To Cheng and Hung, Yu Ju",10.1080/24721840.2024.2358763,,,24721832,International Journal of Aerospace Psychology,"Gamification,air force,board games,flight training,pilot",0,1--15,,Routledge,{Gamification of Learning Aviation Knowledge for Improving the Efficiency of Flight Training},https://doi.org/10.1080/24721840.2024.2358763,0,2024
article,Roberts2022,"Mathematics is foundational to integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Problem solving is central to integrated STEM and to the individual disciplines as evidenced by the practice standards of each discipline (e.g., Standards for Mathematical Practice, Science and Engineering Practices, and Technology and Engineering Practices). We situate integrated STEM as problem-solving practices by synthesizing practice standards from each discipline into four integrated STEM practices: (1) use critical and creative thinking to define and solve problems, (2) collaborate and use appropriate tools to engage in iterative problem solving, (3) communicate solutions to problems based on evidence and data, and (4) recognize and use structures in real-world systems. The integrated STEM practices are critical components of high-quality STEM learning experiences that allow students to apply discipline specific content to authentic problems. When each and every student is provided access and opportunity to high-quality integrated STEM learning experiences, they understand how mathematics is used in the real world and have more favorable views of mathematics.

article,Estaiteyeh2023,"Differentiated instruction (DI) is a teaching approach that aims to achieve learning for diverse students. This study reports on promoting STEM teacher candidates' (TCs') implementation of technology-enhanced DI in teacher education courses. The research questions are: (1) How do TCs develop digital video games (DVGs) to be inclusive of DI?, and (2) If, and to what extent are DVGs effective tools to implement DI in secondary science classes? The analysis of eight DVGs, developed by the TCs, shows that most TCs were able to proficiently integrate DI practices in their DVGs. Furthermore, DVGs are effective tools to differentiate instruction by facilitating pacing variation for different students, differentiating difficulty levels, scaffolding, integrating multimodalities to present the content in different formats, utilizing engaging features, representing different learners of various backgrounds, promoting conceptual understanding, and enabling different assessment forms especially formative and diagnostic assessments. This research is significant as it highlights how digital resources such as DVGs can be used to address individual learners' needs, interests, profiles, and academic achievement levels.

article,Kotsiou2022,"Many agree that education needs new goals that reflect the demands of the future. These are often called ‘Future Skills', referring to the knowledge, attitudes, values, skills, and competencies intended to prepare learners for the future. The need to teach such Future Skills is often cited, justified by the perception that the future will present new challenges for society. However, the various frameworks discussing Future Skills, often created and published without consensus, use hundreds of terms to refer to such skills and competencies, presenting a barrier to discussion of education futures. If we are to design a better future for education, then a cohesive analysis must link and synthesise these isolated frameworks published worldwide. This scoping review utilises thematic analysis and Social Network Analysis to develop meta-categories representing clusters of future skills reported by extant research. Having started with 99 frameworks identified following a systematic search of the literature, which together included 341 different terms, our review identifies nine categories that provide a valuable overview of the field to inform the conceptualisation of Future Skills. Educational practitioners, human resource professionals, policy makers, and educational technology developers can use the meta-categories to prioritise the integration of certain skills into teaching, learning, and retraining.

article,Bowen2020,"School science is often very different from ""real world"" science. One important difference, and possibly the main one, is that in school science the relationships between variables have often been sanitized -- essentially ""cleaned up"" -- so that there is very little (and often no) variation in the data from the relationship students are being taught about. This happens because school science often (a) deals with ""settled"" or ""consensus"" science where scientists have essentially agreed on what the relationships between the variables are; (b) involves bivariate (i.e., two-variable) relationships where all other variables that might be in a ""real world"" relationship have been identified and are removed from the example dataset/activity (e.g., minimizing friction so it becomes negligible to understand movement); and, (c) involve known ""controlled variables"" that can be easily controlled to reduce their influence on the outcomes. This type of removal of variation is problematic as it can make it more difficult for students to learn about, understand, and make sense of ""real world"" data relationships outside of school settings. It is therefore important for them to engage in school investigations that help them learn to make sense of data with considerable variation in the measured variables.

article,VanZyl2016,"As part of curriculum changes in South Africa, an introductory programming language, Scratch, must first be taught before switching to the well-established teaching of Delphi. The nature of programming in Scratch is considerably different from that in Delphi. It was assumed that the teaching of Scratch as introductory programming language could support learners' understanding of Delphi. Teachers did not receive much training in Scratch. This study explores teachers' experiences of their first year of the teaching of Scratch. The purpose of the research was to understand how Scratch can be used effectively as a transitioning language to Delphi and to deduce guidelines for teaching Scratch as introduction to objectoriented programming in Delphi. A qualitative research method, within the interpretive paradigm, was selected for this research. Interviews were done with eight randomly selected Information Technology (IT) teachers in the province of North-West, South Africa to gain insight into their experiences of teaching Scratch in 2012, the first year of implementing the new curriculum. Findings show that teachers were uncertain how to teach programming concepts and how to integrate problem solving and algorithm design into teaching Scratch. The focus of teaching was on Scratch, instead of on teaching programming concepts with Scratch. Emerging guidelines emphasise the integration of problem solving and algorithm design; the creation of opportunities to expose learners to error handling and program testing; and the inculcatation of programming concepts. We furthermore recommend active teachinglearning strategies such as pair programming.",,,,"{Van Zyl}, Sukie and Mentz, Elsa and Havenga, Marietjie",10.1080/18117295.2016.1189215,,,24697656,"African Journal of Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education","Delphi,Introductory programming language,Object-oriented programming,Scratch,Teaching programming,Visual programming language",2,131--141,,Routledge,{Lessons learned from teaching scratch as an introduction to object-oriented programming in delphi},https://doi.org/10.1080/18117295.2016.1189215,20,2016
article,Pajchel2021,"In line with international debate, there is a discussion in Norway on developing teacher education by moving from a more experience-based to a research-based approach. This ongoing change presents a challenge, not only for the development of teacher education but also for teachers working as mentors in school placements. The aim of this study was to investigate science mentors' views on research-based teacher education and the contribution of school placement therein. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 11 mentors working as science teachers in Norwegian primary and secondary schools. Data analysis was based on a thematic analytical approach. The results demonstrate that mentors display a mixed and limited understanding of research-based teacher education, and that developing an understanding of what it means in both contexts (on campus and in school placements) needs to be addressed. Mentors view school placement as an arena in which student teachers can freely test different teaching methodologies. Currently, school placement appears to be experienced as somewhat separate from teaching on campus. However, we conclude that school placement founded in a common knowledge base within research-based teacher education can function as a bridge between theory and practice.",,,,"Pajchel, Katarina and Jegstad, Kirsti Marie and Eklund, Gunilla and Aalbergsj{\o}, Siv G. and Sollid, Per{\O}yvind",10.1080/13540602.2021.1933416,,,13540602,Teachers and Teaching: Theory and Practice,"Initial teacher education,research-based teacher education,research-informed teaching,science education",1-4,193--205,,Routledge,{The role of school placement within research-based teacher education–through the eyes of science mentors},https://doi.org/10.1080/13540602.2021.1933416,27,2021

article,Lui2024,"Debugging (or troubleshooting) provides a rich context to foster problem-solving. Yet, while we know much about some problems and strategies that novices face in programming on-screen, we know far less about debugging and troubleshooting in the context of physical computing, where coding issues may overlap with materially embedded problems. In this paper, we study the thought processes novice students employed and the challenges they faced in debugging an electronic textile project with multiple overlapping problems that crossed physical, electronic, and computational domains. We employed a think-aloud protocol to develop an instrumental case study by video-recording 45 minutes of one pair of 9th-grade students debugging and fixing a buggy e-textile project. The problem space included the computational system's programmatic, electronic, and physical spatial aspects, which are more generally reflective of physical computing systems. We found that (1) students' troubleshooting was more recursive and less linear than traditional approaches that usually propose linear, procedural, step-wise activities, and (2) students coordinated their approach across multiple modalities, taking advantage of a distributed set of tools and people in order to tackle a complex set of problems.

article,Borowicz2023,"The article deals with the role and impact of advanced technologies on literary education. In the beginning, the author emphasizes fundamentally different cognitive objectives of empirical science and humanities. In the authors' opinion, the current scientification of the humanities leads to the domination of a single type of knowledge based on empiricism promoted in schools as a part of the so-called STEM education. A visible manifestation of this process is the labification of school learning methods. The laboratory metaphor may, however, be destructive for the non-science studies. Thereafter, the author outlines how advanced technologies can be used to teach literature according to the specificity of the cognitive model of philological studies. Through the example of an ongoing research project he shows how using cultural heritage sites and embedded education can enhance the process of studying literature, and thus help students develop new interpretative pathways and cognitive skills based on elements typical for digital environments and augmented reality.",,,,"Borowicz, Sebastian",10.1080/07380569.2023.2244940,,,15287033,Computers in the Schools,"Advanced technologies,STEM education,cognitive models,embedded education,heritage sites,literature,transversal mind",4,356--369,,Routledge,{Technopaideia in Literary Education},https://doi.org/10.1080/07380569.2023.2244940,40,2023
article,Sentance2018,"Situated learning theory maintains that there is a relationship between learning and the social situation in which it occurs; learning is embedded in activity, context and culture. In terms of professional learning for teachers, this implies that effective learning takes place within a community where experts and novices meet and where practice is modelled; such a community needs to be deeply relevant to everyday practice in the classroom. In this paper, we discuss Computing At School, a grass-roots organisation that has grown up over the last 10 years through teacher communities, and also with broad support of academia and industry. In a time of increased interest in the inclusion of computer science in school curricular, Computing At School is a community of practice of all teachers affected by curriculum change in Computing and models an innovative approach to professional learning that is based on community and support.

article,Chen2019,"Background and Context: The relationship between novices' first programming language and their future achievement has drawn increasing interest owing to recent efforts to expand K–12 computing education. This article contributes to this topic by analyzing data from a retrospective study of more than 10,000 undergraduates enrolled in introductory computer science courses at 118 U.S. institutions of higher education. Objective: We explored the relationship between students' first programming languages and both their final grades in an introductory computer science course and their attitudes about programming. Method: Multiple matching techniques compared those whose first language was graphical (e.g., Scratch), textual (e.g., Java), or absent prior to college. Findings: Having any prior programming experience had positive effects on both attitudes about programming and grades in introductory computer science courses. Importantly, students whose first language was graphical had higher grades than did students whose first language was textual, when the languages were introduced in or before early adolescent years. Implications: Learning any computer language is better than learning none. If programming is to be taught to students before early adolescence, it is advised to start with a graphical language.

article,Jones2019,"The field of data-driven news production and delivery is maturing, and public service media are among a wide range of news organisations innovating to exploit these advances.

Findings suggest atomised news is viewed by the organisation as offering opportunities for greater efficiency and personalisation and sits within a broader turn towards “structured journalism.” We highlight three characteristics of atomisation—recording, recombining and re-use—to illustrate how it breaks from traditional approaches. We find journalists are “writing for machines” by converting unstructured information into structured data to enable automated recombination and future re-use of content. This impacts editorial control by delegating responsibility to either the algorithm or the audience, in the name of choice. We propose a research agenda that maps the field of structured journalism, contextualises it in the politics of data and technology, and further considers the implications for public service journalism.",,,,"Jones, Rhianne and Jones, Bronwyn",10.1080/21670811.2019.1609372,,,2167082X,Digital Journalism,"Atomised news,BBC,automated journalism,computational journalism,public service media,structured journalism",8,1157--1179,,Routledge,{Atomising the News: The (In)Flexibility of Structured Journalism},https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2019.1609372,7,2019

Through in-depth qualitative coding, we analyzed 6 months of early partnership exchanges to identify how we, as university partners, facilitated discourse and what roles parents and teachers assumed within our third space. Results found that university partners frequently invited participation among partners and used revoicing strategies, and parents and teachers adopted roles as educators and advisors to the program design and implementation.

In this study, we explore how preservice teachers‧ learn to teach scientific practices while teaching plate tectonic theory. In particular, our aim is to observe which scientific practices preservice teachers use while teaching an earth science unit, how do they integrate these practices into their lessons, and what challenges do they face during their first time teaching of an earth science content area integrated with scientific practices. The study is designed as a qualitative, exploratory case study of seven preservice teachers while they were learning to teach plate tectonic theory to a group of middle school students. The data were driven from the video records and artifacts of the preservice teachers‧ learning and teaching processes as well as written reflections on the teaching. Intertextual discourse analysis was used to understand what scientific practices preservice teachers choose to integrate into their teaching experience. Our results showed that preservice teachers chose to focus on four aspects of scientific practices: (1) employing historical understanding of how the theory emerged, (2) encouraging the use of evidence to build up a theory, (3) observation and interpretation of data maps, and (4) collaborative practices in making up the theory. For each of these practices, we also looked at the common challenges faced by preservice teachers by using constant comparative analysis. We observed the practices that preservice teachers decided to use and the challenges they faced, which were determined by what might have come as in their personal history as learners.

As a way forward, I suggest that by reimagining how we teach game studies' genesis point, it will offer up the potential for a brighter, more diverse future for our field.",,,,"Bergstrom, Kelly",10.1080/15295036.2022.2080847,,,14795809,Critical Studies in Media Communication,"Game studies,curriculum,education,feminist game studies,syllabus design",3,173--180,,NCA Website,{Ignoring the blood on the tracks: exits and departures from game studies},https://doi.org/10.1080/15295036.2022.2080847,39,2022
article,Vuyk2024,"The objective of this study is to examine the educational experiences of gifted students in Paraguay through the lens of the Actiotope Model of Giftedness, which provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing the interplay between environmental and individual factors in the development of giftedness.In Paraguay, the approach to gifted education is guided by Law No. 5136/2013 on Inclusive Education, which focuses on providing tailored education to students with diverse cognitive abilities. The Ministry of Education and Sciences (MEC) further develops this approach in its Resolution 1188/2023, introducing specific strategies for supporting gifted students. These strategies include Curricular Enrichment, offering enriched learning experiences tailored to individual abilities, interests, and learning styles, and Flexible Promotion, allowing for the advancement of students through education based on their intellectual development and social maturity. Despite these efforts, national evaluations indicate a gap in achieving minimum educational standards, with only 4.4% of students demonstrating outstanding performance. The economic support for gifted education relies heavily on public and private contributions, often placing a significant financial burden on families. Furthermore, cultural misconceptions about giftedness, such as the belief that gifted children will succeed without additional support, and a lack of specialized training for educators pose ongoing challenges. Amidst these limitations, initiatives like educational robotics and participation in international competitions showcase areas where Paraguay's gifted students excel. However, there is a clear need for a more structured financial approach and comprehensive educational strategies to enhance the support for gifted students.",,,,"Vuyk, Alexandra and Montania, Maureen and Barrios, Liz and Lobo, Montserrat",10.1080/2331186X.2024.2332863,,,2331186X,Cogent Education,"Actiotope model of giftedness,Education Policy & Politics,Inclusion and Special Educational Needs,International & Comparative Education,Paraguay,Sadiq Ismail, United Arab Emirates University, Uni,mathematics education,talent development",1,2332863,,Cogent OA,{Gifted education in Paraguay: analyses from a learning-resource perspective},https://doi.org/10.1080/2331186X.2024.2332863,11,2024
article,Vandenberg2023,"Background and Context: Students' self-efficacy toward computing affect their participation in related tasks and courses. Self-efficacy is likely influenced by students' initial experiences and exposure to computer science (CS) activities. Moreover, student interest in a subject likely informs their ability to effectively regulate their learning in that domain. One way to enhance interest in CS is through using collaborative pair programming. Objective: We wanted to explore upper elementary students' self-efficacy for and conceptual understanding of CS as manifest in collaborative and regulated discourse during pair programming. Method: We implemented a five-week CS intervention with 4th and 5th grade students and collected self-report data on students' CS attitudes and conceptual understanding, as well as transcripts of dyads talking while problem solving on a pair programming task. Findings: The students' self-report data, organized by dyad, fell into three categories based on the dyad's CS self-efficacy and conceptual understanding scores. Findings from within- and cross-case analyses revealed a range of ways the dyads' self-efficacy and CS conceptual understanding affected their collaborative and regulated discourse. Implications: Recommendations for practitioners and researchers are provided. We suggest that upper elementary students learn about productive disagreement and how to peer model.

This paper reports findings from a foundational study to explore the natural strengths, skills, and strategies that upper elementary students bring to reasoning about data-centred problems. It was the first phase of a project that aimed to design and test activities to promote data literacy among upper elementary students. Clinical interviews with students in grades 3, 4, and 5 centred on a series of non-mathematical data ‘scenarios' designed to elicit students' reasoning about data without requiring them to manipulate or interpret tabular or graphical representations. The findings indicate that young students were able to reason about multivariate problems and were particularly adept at thinking critically about the data sources and evidence in the data.

article,Burckhardt2021,"Revisiting the seminal 2010 Nolan and Temple Lang article on the role of computing in the statistics curricula, we discuss several trends that have emerged over the last ten years. The rise of data science has coincided with a broadening audience for learning statistics and using computational packages and tools. It has also increased the need for communication skills. We argue that, for most of this audience, instruction should focus on foundational concepts and the early introduction of different types of data and modern methods through the use of interactive learning environments without programming prerequisites. We then describe Integrated Statistics Learning Environment (ISLE), a web-based e-learning platform and lesson authoring framework for teaching statistics. Built on top of computing and peer-to-peer technology, the platform allows collaborative data analysis and real-time interactions in the classroom. We describe how ISLE contributes to the three key Nolan and Temple Lang components: broadening the statistical computing curriculum, deepening computational reasoning and literacy, and expanding computing with data in the practice of statistics. We then present several advantages of using a computing-integrated environment such as ISLE, including promoting (cross-disciplinary) communication, supporting classroom-focused integrated development environments, and advancing the science of data science.",,,,"Burckhardt, Philipp and Nugent, Rebecca and Genovese, Christopher R.",10.1080/10691898.2020.1854637,,,26939169,Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education,"Computing,Data science,E-learning,Integrated Statistics Learning Environment,Statistics curriculum",S1,S61--S73,,Taylor & Francis,{Teaching Statistical Concepts and Modern Data Analysis With a Computing-Integrated Learning Environment},https://doi.org/10.1080/10691898.2020.1854637,29,2021

With these efforts, it will be important to document shifts in science instruction toward the goals of NGSS and broader science education reform.

A comprehensive survey and a clearly defined set of items do not exist. Moreover, items specific to the NGSS Science and Engineering practices have not yet been tested. To address this need, we developed and validated a Science Instructional Practices survey instrument that is appropriate for NGSS and other related science standards. Survey construction was based on a literature review establishing key areas of science instruction, followed by a systematic process for identifying and creating items. Instrument validity and reliability were then tested through a procedure that included cognitive interviews, expert review, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (using independent samples), and analysis of criterion validity.

article,Antink-Meyer2016,"The aim of this exploratory study was to learn about the misconceptions that may arise for elementary and high school science teachers in their reflections on science and engineering practice. Using readings and videos of real science and engineering work, teachers' reflections were used to uncover the underpinnings of their understandings. This knowledge ultimately provides information about supporting professional development (PD) for science teachers' knowledge of engineering. Six science teachers (two elementary and four high school teachers) participated in the study as part of an online PD experience. Cunningham and Carlsen's (Journal of Science Teacher Education 25:197–210, 2014) relative emphases of science and engineering practices were used to frame the design of PD activities and the analyses of teachers' views. Analyses suggest misconceptions within the eight practices of science and engineering from the US Next Generation Science Standards in four areas. These are that: (1) the nature of the practices in both science and engineering research is determined by the long-term implications of the research regardless of the nature of the immediate work, (2) engineering and science are hierarchical, (3) creativity is inappropriate, and (4) research outcomes cannot be processes.

However, when alternative approaches (See Section IV in this paper) are encouraged, microscopy provides opportunities for hands-on learning, engagement, use of models, and gaining a sense of size, scale, and hierarchical organisation. This article reviews living organism- and ecosystem-based microscopy originally designed for gifted and talented education, and how it could support the NGSS Life Science Framework. The paper begins with a review of curriculum, then discusses (1) five ongoing microscope applications relevant to the NGSS, including mini-ponds modelling ecosystem-organism functions; (2) data from pre- and post-testing as a measure of comprehensive learning; and, (3) a culminating communication project/exhibit on pond life, environmental conditions, and pollution effects.",,,,"Cohen, Joel I.",10.1080/00219266.2020.1720772,,,21576009,Journal of Biological Education,"Gifted and talented,Microscopy,NGSS,biology education,pollution,protists,secondary education",5,518--527,,Routledge,"{Applications of microscopy in science education: gifted youth, public school, and the next-generation science standards (NGSS)}",https://doi.org/10.1080/00219266.2020.1720772,55,2021

article,Toews2012,"Mathematical modeling occupies an unusual space in the undergraduate mathematics curriculum: typically an ""advanced"" course, it nonetheless has little to do with formal proof, the usual hallmark of advanced mathematics. Mathematics departments are thus forced to decide what role they want the modeling course to play, both as a component of the mathematics major and as a course with potential cross-disciplinary appeal.This article takes the position that a modeling course de-emphasizing mathematical formalism in favor of scientific computing, data analysis, and communication skills is both an appropriate upper-level mathematics course and an effective means of training real-world problem solvers. Designing a course that serves a broad range of students while remaining practically relevant and mathematically sophisticated can be a challenge, however. Here the author distills key features of his recent course with a group of 20 undergraduates from widely different majors. Comments about course outcomes are contextualized by a broader discussion about real-world modeling practices. The piece concludes with a list of concrete ideas about target competencies and the ways in which they can be achieved. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,"Toews, Carl",10.1080/10511970.2011.648003,,,10511970,Primus,"Modeling,computation,data analysis,education",7,545--563,,Taylor & Francis,{Mathematical Modeling in the Undergraduate Curriculum},https://doi.org/10.1080/10511970.2011.648003,22,2012

article,Wells2006,"In Life Itself and in Essays on Life Itself, Robert Rosen (1991, 2000) argued that machines were, in principle, incapable of modeling the defining feature of living systems, which he claimed to be the existence of closed causal loops. Rosen's argument has been used to support critiques of computational models in ecological psychology. This article shows that Rosen's attack on mechanism is fundamentally misconceived. It is, in fact, of the essence of a mechanical system that it contains closed causal loops. Moreover, Rosen's epistemology is based on a strong form of indirect realism and his arguments, if correct, would call into question some of the fundamental principles of ecological psychology.

article,Worsley2022,"Background and Context: Making is celebrated for bringing exciting tools and learning opportunities to non-traditional designers. However, people with disabilities may find themselves excluded from many making activities and makerspaces. This exclusion is present in making and computer science more broadly. Objective: We describe a university course that helps broaden their awareness of accessibility in computing and promote accessible making solutions. The course engages students in critical examination of making and allows them to instantiate their learning by designing accessible interfaces and experiences. We study the design of the course and its impacts on students. Method: We use techniques from grounded theory to analyze data from surveys, projects, and case studies to elucidate the need and the impact of this experience. Findings: The course filled an important need for students and people with disabilities. By applying a critical disability lens to making, participants developed expansive views of making, both in terms of what “counts” as making and who can participate in it. Implications: Courses on accessibility address important societal and individual needs that are currently not met by CS curricula. Courses that address these needs should include critical discussions of the domain in question and involve various types of community partnerships. Including these course elements can expand the course's impact, lead to better project designs, and change perceptions of what is valuable in computing experiences.",,,,"Worsley, Marcelo and Bar-El, David",10.1080/08993408.2020.1863705,,,17445175,Computer Science Education,"Disability,design,higher education,identity,making,physical computing",2,155--187,,Routledge,{Inclusive Making: designing tools and experiences to promote accessibility and redefine making},https://doi.org/10.1080/08993408.2020.1863705,32,2022
article,Appelgren2018,"This study explores paternalism in contemporary data journalism, a hybrid form of journalism where parts of the engineering culture are blended with the culture of journalism. Technologists often question paternalistic elements in design, whereas journalists consider paternalistic decision-making to be justified as an inherent part of what journalism is. Based on a predominately qualitative content analysis of paternalistic elements in 31 data journalistic projects submitted to the Nordic Data Journalism Awards in 2013, 2015 and 2016, three characteristics of paternalism were found: controlling functionality, the illusion of interactivity and linearity. All three characteristics include several types of control over the audience control, embedded in the design, and as previous research has found that paternalism is often associated with negative effects, on the basis of journalistic choices in design and presentation involving technology, the problem is whether the audience begins to perceive data journalism as controlling, non-transparent or intrusive.",,,,"Appelgren, Ester",10.1080/17512786.2017.1299032,,,17512794,Journalism Practice,"control,data journalism,design,interactivity,paternalism,user experience",3,308--325,,Routledge,{An Illusion of Interactivity: The paternalistic side of data journalism},https://doi.org/10.1080/17512786.2017.1299032,12,2018

article,Flamenbaum2024,"Building on decades of interdisciplinary language-centered research on literacies, this article is an exploration of the many ideologies about technology, literacy, and “good” learners, and the resulting tangle of contradictory practices, that converge in rural Ghanaian Information and Communication Technology (ICT) classrooms. In addition to tracing how Western ideologies of technological transformation were imported into the design of ICT policy and curricula via international development organizations, the article contrasts the enduring routines and practices of hierarchical knowledge transfer in Ghanaian classrooms with assumptions about exploratory users embedded in the design of technologies primarily produced in and for North American contexts. In doing so, the article highlights the regimes of participation (Flamenbaum & George 2023), or the interplay between these taken-for-granted ideologies, technological affordances, and available roles for participation in knowledge production, which dynamically structure participatory engagements with digital literacies.

article,Takeuchi2020,"Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education garnered significant attention in recent years and has emerged as a key field of research globally. The goal of this article is to offer a critical review of how STEM education and its transdisciplinarity were defined and/or positioned in empirical studies published during the early formulation of the field. In particular, we sought to identify how these studies conceptualise learners and learning and portray the underlying assumptions in light of the macrosystemic discourses that often serve as ideological forces in shaping research and practice of STEM education. We examined 154 peer-reviewed articles published between January 2007 and March 2018 and analysed them along several emergent dimensions: their geospatial focus, focal disciplinary areas, methodological and theoretical assumptions, and major findings. Grounded in a critical transdisciplinary perspective, we used critical discourse analysis to identify how macrosystemic and institutionalised forces–overtly and implicitly–shape what counts as STEM education research, including its goals and conceptualisations of learners and learning.

article,Hsiao2024,"The study explored the effects of gamifying learning materials on the health care knowledge and emotions of middle-aged and older adults. A quasi-experimental research study was conducted to examine the effects of different learning approaches on the health care knowledge and emotional experiences of middle-aged and older adults. A total of 84 people voluntarily participated in this study and were assigned to three treatment groups: board games, digital games, and traditional instruction. The findings revealed that participants who engaged with board games demonstrated better health care knowledge than those who used digital games. Additionally, they reported positive emotions, such as pride and relaxation. In contrast, participants who accessed digital games were more likely to experience negative emotions, such as shame, sadness, and hopelessness. For middle-aged and older adults using digital games, it is important to consider their levels of technology acceptance, as this significantly influences their intention to use these tools.

article,Newland2022,"Turn on the flash light and camera on your computer. Put your finger over the light and watch as the light changes with each beat of your heart. You can see your pulse in real time. What is a pulse? Every time your heart beats, blood is pumped through your circulatory system producing a rhythm, which is the pulse. The rhythm is a signal we can measure. First, there is the lub or systole (SIS-toe-lee), which is the point of highest pressure in a heartbeat, and then your heart relaxes and refills during the dub or diastole (die-ASS-toe-lee). So how does light equal blood flow? When light enters the skin, the blood in the capillaries absorbs some light and reflects some back. When blood volume in the capillaries is highest during the systole, more light is absorbed, so less light is reflected. By putting a sensor right next to the light source, we can measure this change in light reflected from the capillaries. More light means less blood at that moment.

article,Ward2018,"One STEAM (STEM + Arts) strategy is to supplement traditional STEM instruction with music. Using music could provide the dual benefits of (1) making STEM content more accessible and (2) enhancing students' engagement in the learning process. Here we explore the extent to which music-oriented high school students achieve these two benefits when they participate in ‘Songwriting To Learn', a possible variation on the Writing To Learn (WTL) model of instruction. We analysed 81 artist statements, collected over 12 years at an annual science fair, in which students described their music compositions and the compositions' connections to science. Rather than simply reporting scientific facts in song lyrics, these students used an impressive variety of musical elements (Genre, Instruments, Lyrics, and Structure [i.e. chords, dynamics, melody, rhythm]) as metaphors or symbols for science-related elements (Scientific Topic, Conveying Information, Affect, Personal Story, Scientific Story). Many students demonstrated a sophisticated attention to musical details and nuances, consistent with their frequent self-identification as musicians and/or music fans. Moreover, in composing and performing songs, these students fulfilled some of the key criteria by which scientific identities are developed, including the forging of personal connections to science. By writing songs about science, students may use their practice-linked identities in the domain of music to express their growing understanding in the domain of science.",,,,"Ward, Sarah J. and Price, Rebecca M. and Davis, Katie and Crowther, Gregory J.",10.1080/21548455.2018.1492758,,,21548463,"International Journal of Science Education, Part B: Communication and Public Engagement","ArtSci,Arts integration,content-rich music,practice-linked identity",4,307--324,,Routledge,{Songwriting to learn: how high school science fair participants use music to communicate personally relevant scientific concepts},https://doi.org/10.1080/21548455.2018.1492758,8,2018

article,Peppler2018,"Recent advances in arts education policy, as outlined in the latest National Core Arts Standards, advocate for bringing digital media into the arts education classroom. The promise of such Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM)–based approaches is that, by coupling Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and the arts, new understandings and artifacts emerge that transcend either discipline. Evidence of this can be seen through fundamental shifts in both fields; in the arts, artists are expanding the creative potential for design through computational flexibility, which affords artists the ability to exceed the limitations of their tools. The infusion of the arts into STEM has shown to be equally transformative, with the emergence of tools and communities that not only engender new content understandings but also invite participation from populations historically underrepresented in STEM fields. Drawing on over a decade of research at the intersection of the arts, creativity, and new technologies from the Creativity Labs at Indiana University, this article theorizes the learning that takes place at effective couplings of STEAM to assist today's educators in realizing the potential for transformative experiences for learners of all levels. This article provides a synthesis of this past work across two compelling cases of STEAM-based tools, materials, and activities (i.e., the media-rich programming environment Scratch as well as the work the LilyPad Arduino used to create electronic textiles), incorporating findings from more than 50 peer-reviewed papers and books, and conceptually outlines an approach to “gathering STEAM” in arts education classrooms today. Implications are explored for policy makers in teacher education to think about preservice curriculum and field experiences; policy makers in arts education to think about tools needed in classrooms today; as well as how art education can play a critical role in STEM disciplines and offer solutions to address STEM pipeline challenges. Such efforts extend current and prior discussions in the arts education landscape about the use of new technologies, and draw our attention to how new technologies can be leveraged for artistic expression.",,,,"Peppler, Kylie and Wohlwend, Karen",10.1080/10632913.2017.1316331,,,19404395,Arts Education Policy Review,"Arts education,Scratch,computer science,media arts,nexus theory",2,88--99,,Routledge,{Theorizing the nexus of STEAM practice},https://doi.org/10.1080/10632913.2017.1316331,119,2018

This study explored how partnering scientists and students on a social media platform supported students' development of disciplinary practice knowledge through practice-based learning with experts during two pilot enactments of a project-based curriculum focusing on the ecological impacts of climate change. Through the online platform, scientists provided feedback on students' infographics, visual argumentation artifacts that use data to communicate about climate change science. We conceptualize the infographics and professional data sets as boundary objects that supported authentic argumentation practices across classroom and professional contexts, but found that student generated data was not robust enough to cross these boundaries. Analysis of the structure and content of the scientists' feedback revealed that when critiquing argumentation, scientists initiated engagement in multiple scientific practices, supporting a holistic rather than discrete model of practice-based learning. While traditional classroom inquiry has emphasized student experimentation, we found that engagement with existing professional data sets provided students with a platform for developing expertise in systemic scientific practices during argument construction.

article,Nijenhuis-Voogt2023,"Background and Context: Computing education is expanding, while the teaching of algorithms is less well studied. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) for teaching algorithms. Method: We conducted semi-structured interviews with seven computer science (CS) teachers in upper secondary education (students aged 15–18). The data were analyzed qualitatively. Findings: We found two patterns of variation in teachers' PCK. First, we detected variation in the teachers' goals related to their view of algorithms: they either focused on “thinking” about the algorithm as an object, or focused on “thinking and making”, where the algorithm is also regarded as a program.

article,Teo2024,"Many empirical studies about STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) curriculum present problems for students to solve. This paper draws upon the data collected from the enactment of an integrated STEM curriculum to discuss problems as constitutive of problem spaces where four Grade 5 Singapore students engage with the materialities and relationships to generate solutions from these spaces. The study seeks to address the nature of the problem spaces in STEM inquiry. Derived from the emergent coding of 12 hours of lesson videos, the findings illuminated that problem spaces emerged from familiar and dissimilar contexts in the curriculum. These problem spaces embodied epistemic infrastructures and epistemic emotions within which students exercised agency to collaborate productively and learn. Implications for STEM curriculum making that foregrounded epistemic considerations, rather than outcome-based learning, were discussed. This paper helps to further the field of curriculum studies in STEM education by contributing to the theorization of STEM curriculum by applying a process lens to deepen understanding of problems as problem spaces.",,,,"Teo, Tang Wee",10.1080/00220272.2023.2297226,,,13665839,Journal of Curriculum Studies,"STEM curriculum,integrated,problem spaces,process lens",1,35--57,,Routledge,{Problem spaces in STEM inquiry: a case analysis of an integrated curriculum},https://doi.org/10.1080/00220272.2023.2297226,56,2024

article,Hu2023,"Background: Creativity is one of the key competencies for the talent of the 21st century to meet future challenges in a complex world. It is also an innovative basis for students to discover and pose questions. Purpose: This study aimed to explore which two interventions of the problem-oriented teaching model, teacher-guided problem finding (TGPF) and teacher-directed question posing (TDQP), was more effective in terms of improving students' creativity in STEM education. Sample: A total of 60 seventh-grade students participated in this study. Design and methods: The TGPF group included 30 students who adopted the problem-finding method in which the teacher guided them to find problems, while another 30 students in the TDQP group adopted the method in which the teacher directly posed the questions. The Williams Creativity Aptitude Test (WCAT) was used to test the pre- and post-creativity of the two groups. Paired samples t tests were used to verify whether the two interventions of the problem-oriented teaching model could enhance students' creativity, and independent samples t tests were used to verify the differences between the two interventions of the problem-oriented teaching model in the enhancement of creativity. Results: The results indicated that both TGPF and TDQP can improve students' creativity. Compared with the TDQP group, the TGPF group's students could better improve their creativity, especially in the dimensions of adventure, imagination, and challenge. Conclusion: This study provides references for teachers to use different problem-oriented teaching interventions in STEM education.

article,Leung2019,"This article offers a critical interpretation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a philosophical notion which exemplifies a secular conception of thinking. One way in which AI notably differs from the conventional understanding of “thinking” is that, according to AI, “intelligence” or “thinking” does not necessarily require “life” as a precondition: that it is possible to have “thinking without life.” Building on Charles Taylor's critical account of secularity as well as Hubert Dreyfus' influential critique of AI, this article offers a theological analysis of AI's “lifeless” picture of thinking in relation to the Augustinian conception of God as “Life itself.” Following this critical theological analysis, this article argues that AI's notion of thinking promotes a societal privilege of certain rationalistic or calculative ways of thought over more existential or spiritual ways of thinking, and thereby fosters a secularization or de-spiritualization of thinking as an ethical human practice.",,,,"Leung, King Ho",10.1080/1462317X.2019.1605725,,,17431719,Political Theology,"Artificial intelligence,ontology,philosophy of technology,secularization,selfhood",6,457--471,,Routledge,{The Picture of Artificial Intelligence and the Secularization of Thought},https://doi.org/10.1080/1462317X.2019.1605725,20,2019

article,McGregor2019,"Understanding the nature of science (NoS) is perplexing for young children because it is concerned with not only understanding how evidence is generated but also what kind of meanings can be made from information collected. However, acting as a scientist-in-role, making independent decisions about what information to collect and deciding how to go about it, can enable students to experience scientific practices that empower them to better appreciate and understand the NoS. This paper illustrates how drama processes, in two international settings in Wellington, New Zealand and Oxford, United Kingdom encouraged nine to ten-year-old children to engage in the scientific ‘as-if' world. The data collected from these two locations was analysed deductively to illustrate how working-in-role can influence the nature of learning and shape the scientific practices experienced that consequently inform how the NoS is understood. The children in Wellington (New Zealand) worked in-role as atmospheric scientists to design a reduced-emissions race track. The class in Oxford (UK) adopted the role of technological scientists theorising about properties of materials to create and test original carriers designed to transport a range of everyday objects. How drama promoted working-in-role to experience scientific practices supporting the understanding of the NoS, are discussed.

article,Haas2021,"W hen we first began integrating computational mod-eling into our science instruction , we saw students compelled to do science in ways that reignited our passion for science teaching. Computational models, or ""representations of phenomena that can be simulated by a computer"" (Weintrop et al. 2015, p. 137), enable students to enhance their understanding of phenomena by exploring and testing the behavior of complex systems. As computational models are becoming more widely used with the release of A Framework for K-12 Science Education (NRC 2012) and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS; NGSS Lead States 2013), these models are reshaping the way science is practiced in increasingly diverse classrooms. For students classified as English learners (ELs), who make up a sizable and fast-growing subset of the student population, computational models provide a powerful resource for communicating science ideas and fostering productive discourse in classroom communities. The purpose of this article is to describe why and how teachers can integrate computational modeling into NGSS-aligned science instruction with all students, including ELs. First, we describe the benefits of computational modeling and how teachers can integrate computational models into science instruction in a way that complements other model types they already use in their classrooms. Second, to illustrate these benefits, we describe how one fifth-grade teacher, Ms. Simon, integrated computational modeling into her science instruction. Specifically, we highlight how the affordances of different model types (physical, diagrammat-ic, computational) allowed all students, including ELs, to explain the phenomenon of garbage and develop deep understanding of physical and life science core ideas. Finally, we offer recommendations for teachers interested in integrating computational modeling into their science instruction with all students. WHY COMPUTATIONAL MODELING Modeling is a central practice of scientists and engineers and one of eight science and engineering practices (SEPs) articulated in the Framework and the NGSS. In the NGSS classroom, students engage in three-dimensional learning as they develop models (SEP) in combination with crosscutting concepts (CCCs) and disciplinary core ideas (DCIs) to construct increasingly sophisticated explanations of phenomena. While modeling is an important practice for all students, ELs in particular benefit from using multiple meaning-making resources (e.g., drawings, symbols, code) beyond just language to communicate their ideas (Grapin 2019). With the emphasis on modeling in the NGSS, teachers are integrating different model types into their science instruction. These include both physical models (i.e., models constructed using physical objects or events) and diagrammatic models (i.e., models constructed using drawings, symbols, and text), with each model type presenting distinct affordances and limitations. For example, students can use physical models to make observations that produce data (i.e., an affordance), but these models do not show invisible processes underlying phenomena, such as matter particles (i.e., a limitation). Given this limitation, students can also develop diagrammatic models to represent invisible processes (i.e., an affordance). However, while diagram-matic models frequently make use of symbols (e.g., arrows) to indicate movement, the static nature of these models makes it difficult to show certain dynamic aspects of phenomena, such as solid particles changing into gas particles (i.e., a limitation). Computational models (i.e., models constructed using a computer) provide affordances that address some of the limitations of physical and diagram-matic models. Specifically, computational models allow students to represent invisible agents (overcoming the main limitation of physical models) while also giving those agents dynamic rules of behavior (overcoming the main limitation of diagrammatic models). Students can then run their computational models to test causal explanations of phenomena in ways that go beyond what is possible with physical and 74 • •",,,,"Haas, Alison and Grapin, Scott and Simon, Katie and Llosa, Lorena and Lee, Okhee",10.1080/19434812.2021.12291679,,,0036-8148,Science and Children,,5,74--79,,Routledge,{Teaching Teachers: Integrating Computational Modeling Into Science Instruction With English Learners},https://doi.org/10.1080/19434812.2021.12291679,58,2021

Methods: Through a contrapuntal approach, which emphasizes a critical lens to analyze empire, we juxtapose notions of authentic practice in computing education with scholarship in sociology that brings the lives of tech industry immigrant workers to the fore. Findings: Our analysis reveals how the social construction of disciplinary and professional expertise in computing is intricately interwoven with historically persistent patterns of the appropriation of the lives and labor of endarkened people through systems of transnational migration and institutional forms of racial segregation.

article,Malazita2019,"Abstraction, defined in Computer Science (CS) as bracketing unnecessary information from diverse components within a system, serves as a central epistemological axis in CS disciplinary and pedagogical practices. Its impressions can be seen across curricula, syllabi, classroom structures, IT systems; and other dimensions of the epistemic infrastructure of CS (Malazita [Forthcoming]. “Epistemic Infrastructures, the Instrumental Turn, and the Digital Humanities.” In Debates in the Digital Humanities: Infrastructures, Institutions at the Interstices, edited by Angel Nieves, Siobhan Senier, and Anne McGrail. University of Minnesota Press). As we will argue in this essay, abstraction in CS serves as an epistemic, cultural, and ideological wall to integrated critical-technical education, rather than as a bridge. Further, this wall is disguised as a bridge: the common language used across CS and the Humanities gives the impression that abstraction can be leveraged as a boundary object (Star [2010]. “This is Not a Boundary Object: Reflections on the Origin of a Concept.” Science, Technology, & Human Values 35 (5): 601–617), as a point of connection among conflicting or incommensurable epistemic cultures (Knorr Cetina [1999]. Epistemic Cultures: How the Sciences Make Knowledge. Cambridge: MIT Press). Rather, computational knowledge practices leverage abstraction's homographic-ness, epistemically structuring collaborative efforts in anti-political ways. To illustrate the impacts of abstraction, this essay will introduce ‘Critical CS1,' a hybrid pedagogical approach to teaching Computer Science through feminist and critical race theory.

article,Williams2017,"Assessment in higher education has focused on the performance of individual students.

article,Lim2022,"This paper reports on the evaluation results of the implementation of the Parallel Curriculum Model (PCM) in a Singapore secondary school for Grades 7-10. PCM was adopted by the school in 2016 to provide a comprehensive framework for designing the school's curriculum around the core, connections, practice, and identity. Two years into the implementation, a systematic review was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of this model on students' learning. A 39-item 5-point scale survey instrument was conceptualized to measure students' self-perception around four constructs—(a) critical and conceptual thinking, (b) problem solving and communication, (c) creative thinking, and (d) learning strategies adopted in the context of PCM curriculum. Rasch analysis of 862 students' level of agreeability to these four constructs reported positive self-views. They also reported engaging effective learning strategies in the PCM curriculum.

article,Tofel-Grehl2023,"The integration of making activities in classrooms provides a crucial opportunity for all students to gain equitable participation access to learning activities. However, for making to be incorporated into more classrooms, teachers must be adequately prepared with relevant knowledge and skills. This study is the first to compare the science learning outcomes associated with making to those stemming from standard learning curricula and experiences within a classroom setting. We examine the learning outcomes of 219 students across multiple sections of one teacher's 9th-grade science classes. While five sections of students were taught using the school's standard learning curriculum, four sections of students engaged in an integrated maker curriculum. A mixed methods approach offers a comprehensive look at the affordances and limitations of maker-based classroom science instruction by coupling student science learning outcomes with student and teacher reflections on instruction and learning.

article,Wang2024a,"Tiny and affordable computers (e.g. Raspberry Pi and Arduino) have been widely applied to technology-enhanced hands-on learning (THL). However, little scholarly attention has been devoted to the key factors behind students' performance in THL contexts. Therefore, this study not only helped the participants learn computer science through THL, but also devised a research model to investigate the major factors affecting their learning performance. In this model, self-efficacy and social support serve as the independent variables, and perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment and behavioral intention act as the mediating variables, while learning performance functions as the dependent variable. The research findings reveal that (1) self-efficacy is a more significantly influential factor than social support behind learning performance; and (2) perceived enjoyment is more significantly influential than perceived usefulness in affecting learning performance via the mediation of behavioral intention. These findings imply that students' self-efficacy in using technologies is more important than others' assistance in THL contexts, since the latter may not be offered in a timely manner, whereas the former will prompt students to solve problems independently and ergo deliver better performance.",,,,"Wang, Ding Chau and Huang, Yong Ming",10.1080/10494820.2022.2127776,,,17445191,Interactive Learning Environments,"Hands-on learning,learning performance,self-efficacy,social support",5,1697--1709,,Routledge,{Self-efficacy is stronger than social support in predicting technology-enhanced hands-on learning},https://doi.org/10.1080/10494820.2022.2127776,32,2024

article,Wang2023,"Solving clinical problems requires an individual to apply not only domain-specific medical knowledge and cognitive skills for reasoning, but also to be consciously aware of, monitor, and evaluate their thinking processes (i.e., metacognition). The purpose of this study was to map critical metacognitive dimensions of clinical problem solving and to explore the structural relationships among them, which may help frame a conceptual framework and better pedagogy for effective intervention. A context-specific inventory was adapted and modified from a domain-general instrument to capture essential metacognitive skills for learning and solving clinical problems. This inventory was administered to 72 undergraduate medical students to survey their capabilities in five dimensions: knowledge of cognition, objectives, problem representation, monitoring, and evaluation. The interplay among these dimensions was further examined using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Our findings revealed that the medical students fell short of some expert-like, metacognitive, and regulatory competence, even after receiving years of medical education and on-site training. In particular, they did not know when a holistic understanding of a problem had been reached. Many of them often do not have a set of clear diagnostic procedures in mind, nor do they concurrently monitor their thinking during diagnostic reasoning. Moreover, their lack of self-improving approaches seemed to worsen their learning. Finally, the structural equation model indicated that knowledge of cognition and objectives significantly predicted problem representation, suggesting that medical learners' knowledge of and goals for learning are influential in framing the clinical problems at hand. A significant linear prediction path was observed from problem representation, monitoring, to evaluation, signifying a possible sequenced process of clinical problem solving.

article,Su2024,"Background: More and more research has recently focused on STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) education, especially early childhood education. To the best of our knowledge, no review studies have focused on theoretical frameworks, the details of learning activities, assessment methods, outcomes, and challenges that educators encounter in early childhood education (ECE) settings. Purpose: This study reports a scoping review of the literature on the characteristics of STEAM in early childhood education, synthesizing empirical studies on STEAM in ECE to understand how STEAM has been taught at the ECE level and to inform future STEAM curriculum development. Methods: The electronic databases used for the literature search included Scopus and Web of Science. A total of 26 articles on STEAM in early childhood education published from 2017 to 2023. Results and Conclusion: This study analysed 26 articles and found that (1) most studies adopted the frameworks provided by global educational initiatives or more local educational policy frameworks to inform their research purpose and design for promoting STEAM to develop student's learning skills; (2) most studies used technologically enhanced learning, followed by inquiry project-based learning; (3) the learning outcomes included knowledge gain, skill acquisition by children, and attitude changes by teachers and parents; (4) mixed-research designs were most commonly used, followed by qualitative designs; and (5) the significant challenges of STEAM education in ECE settings include limited pedagogical content knowledge, negative attitudes towards teaching STEAM, and insufficient teaching guidelines and resources.

Although similarly competitive in many areas, SG is ahead of HK in rankings. Why does this disparity exist? What forms of public sector innovation are crucial for smart city development? This paper answers these questions for policy-makers by examining the role of public sector innovation in driving smart city developments, and underscores the importance of research and development within the public sector. ABSTRACT Since the 2000s, Hong Kong (HK) and Singapore (SG) have been working to reinvent themselves as smart cities. Despite their similarities, SG has consistently ranked ahead of HK on several smart city indices. To explain this gap, the smart city initiatives of both cities were categorized using a six-factor typology of public sector innovation. Further analysis indicated that SG was ahead of HK because its government has been more aggressive in funding and fostering innovation. This paper suggests that a government's financial support for public sector innovation, as well as its ability to redirect resources within the public sector and get citizens involved, will catalyse transformational efforts into a smart city.",,,,"Ang-Tan, Ruth and Ang, Siyuan",10.1080/09540962.2021.1903752,,,14679302,Public Money and Management,"Government research and development,Hong Kong (HK),Singapore,public sector innovation,smart cities,smart city governance",4,231--240,,Routledge,{Understanding the smart city race between Hong Kong and Singapore},https://doi.org/10.1080/09540962.2021.1903752,42,2022

article,Lachney2023,"The claim that research should prioritize qualities of replicability is foundational to scientific knowledge production. At the same time, replication is not an algorithm but instead based on a disciplinary community's values and norms.

We explore our own research collaborations and choices during the 2020–2021 US school year–defined by the COVID-19 pandemic and emergency remote teaching–to recast irreplicability not as a mark of pseudo-science but instead as an inherent part of studying teaching and learning during emergency conditions.

Nevertheless, there is little effort to synthesise these studies.

Consequently, this review synthesises empirical studies investigating STL using TIMSS and PISA. First, we mapped their characteristics based on the aims, data, STL measures, and research approaches. Second, patterns of the findings were summarized by focusing on the (1) relationships between STL and student outcomes; (2) factors that explain STL variation; and (3) patterns of STL. Most studies examined STL related to inquiry activities and their relationships to student outcomes. Their findings were largely inconsistent and could be traced back to different ways STL was conceptualized and measured.

article,Capra2021,"This essay discusses Sloterdijk's anthropotechnical framework as it relates to recent contributions that deal with the inherent opacities of digital technology and processes of blackboxing. I argue that Sloterdijk's philosophy is a precious case of affirmative, non-nihilistic technophilic thinking that espouses the technogenic provenance of mankind, and leaves space for technologically engendered incomprehensibility while tracing a horizon for human beings' resoluteness. In the first section of my essay I tackle Sloterdijk's reflections on the philosophical transition from wonder to horror in the twentieth century, and I put it in dialogue with his concept of the monstrous as defined by boundlessness, complexity, and excess. Here, I discuss how the human being shows both monster-slayer and monstrous tendencies. Secondly, after having revisited the question “what happened in the twentieth century” from this perspective, I discuss how Sloterdijk's analysis of the monstrous provides a coherent genealogy for an assessment of the individual's relation to current “monstrous” technologies, as they are tied to algorithmic processing. I conclude by arguing that Sloterdijk's anthropotechnics and onto-anthropology allow for an acrobatic confrontation with the possibility of untethering technological advancement from illusory promises of absolute clarity, and promote the immunological value of darkness.",,,,"Capra, Andrea",10.1080/0969725X.2021.1863601,,,0969725X,Angelaki - Journal of the Theoretical Humanities,"Peter Sloterdijk,agency,cybernetics,darkness,technology",1,124--141,,Routledge,{STAYING WITH THE DARKNESS: peter sloterdijk's anthropotechnics for the digital age},https://doi.org/10.1080/0969725X.2021.1863601,26,2021
article,Falkner2018,"Computer Science (CS) curricula are being adopted worldwide.

In this paper, we describe an ecosystem-based approach to supporting teacher professional development, aligned with best practices and with teachers' and schools' needs. An ecosystem approach operates under the coordination of a governance model, features a central hub and conceptualises the relationships of the organisations as a network.

article,Wang2022a,"This paper investigates the impact of digital creativity educational practices on the improvement of academic performance and creative thinking development of Chinese high school students. The study defined the importance of the concept of STEM learning in the development of modern skills needed to live and work in a digital socio-economic change caused by the development of Industry 4.0. An educational experiment involving 60 9th grade Chinese students evaluated the impact of digital creativity learning practices on the development of students' creative thinking on such indicators as fluency, flexibility, originality, detailing, and metaphoricity. The impact of digital creative learning practices on the performance of students in the control group and the experimental group was assessed. The analysis of the results of practical research on the impact of digital tools and pedagogical models of learning on the acquisition of students' creative thinking skills was conducted, which proved that the digital environment is the optimal place for students' creative manifestations and provides opportunities to improve creative thinking skills by implementing learning practical activities using innovative tools for the manifestation of digital creative skills.",,,,"Wang, Bin and ping Li, Ping",10.1080/10494820.2022.2155839,,,17445191,Interactive Learning Environments,"AR tools,concept of STEM learning,creative group learning tasks,creative thinking skills,digital creativity,pedagogical learning models",6,2633--2646,,Routledge,{Digital creativity in STEM education: the impact of digital tools and pedagogical learning models on the students' creative thinking skills development},https://doi.org/10.1080/10494820.2022.2155839,32,2022

article,Tan2020,"This article considers the future of STEM education in Singapore, with implications for comparable schooling systems. The Thinking Schools Learning Nation (TSLN) interventions since 1997 brought changes to science education ostensibly for economic competitiveness, the results of which can only become visible in international comparisons in this decade. I propose that TSLN represents a trade between some sacred cows of public schooling in exchange for magic beans, and I assess how well these beans have grown. In terms of economically productive creativity, the metrics present a mixed picture. Three problems that may have been overlooked could have contributed to this outcome: (i) misunderstanding the role of culture in artefact creation and use; (ii) a rational, deficit model for education; and (iii) an underestimation of the complexity of educating for economic goals. To attend to these issues, I propose a holistic vision of a STEM curriculum that recognises the social sciences of STEM as a legitimate concern for STEM educators, and a humanistic pedagogy that eschews deficit models for education. Such a vision recovers the value of the ‘useless' knowledges of the humanities in STEM education, and approaches instruction with an intention towards enabling students to respond to unforeseeable futures.",,,,"Tan, Michael",10.1080/02188791.2020.1838882,,,17426855,Asia Pacific Journal of Education,"STEM education,Science Education,humanistic education,innovation policy,technological determinism,useless knowledge",4,485--500,,Routledge,{STEM as opportunity to get TSLN right: Science education for economically productive creativity},https://doi.org/10.1080/02188791.2020.1838882,40,2020
article,Castronova2020,"This paper reports the qualitative analysis of science teachers' pedagogical reflections while attending institutes focused on the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The researchers collected reflection slips from 165 science teachers (K-12) across 14 different NGSS institutes. To analyze the data, researchers classified teachers' written thoughts using the six subscales included in the Science Teachers' Pedagogical Discontentment (STPD) scale. Doing so revealed that teachers often grounded their reflections in three-dimensional instruction. Looking closely at each dimension, teachers reflected on science and engineering practices (SEPs) more often than the dimensions of disciplinary core ideas (DCIs) and crosscutting concepts (CCs). However, these latter dimensions incited discontentment more than SEPs. Teacher thinking was not confined to classroom practice. A portion of teacher reflections cited the planning process as cognitively demanding, thus, supporting a broader definition of pedagogical discontentment. When considering how teachers realized a mismatch in practice and/or planning, institute discussions incited discontentment to a higher degree than doing an activity or watching a reform-based strategy. These research findings have implications for how future professional developments should be structured to incite dissatisfaction and align teacher thinking with the NGSS vision.",,,,"Castronova, Marisa and Chernobilsky, Ellina",10.1080/1046560X.2019.1710387,,,15731847,Journal of Science Teacher Education,"NGSS,Professional development,pedagogical discontentment,teacher reflections",4,401--413,,Routledge,{Teachers' Pedagogical Reflections on the Next Generation Science Standards},https://doi.org/10.1080/1046560X.2019.1710387,31,2020

article,Bennion2023,"Preservice elementary teachers need to be able to engage young students in science practices but may not have extensive experiences with those practices. They also may have contrasting beliefs about them, which inform their teaching practice. To understand preservice teachers' beliefs related to science practices, we focus on the connections they made between the practices and teaching and learning. We followed nine participants from a physics content course, into a science methods course, and through their student teaching, collecting data including interviews, reflections, and lesson plans. We used our analyses of interviews and reflections to identify participants' “professed beliefs,” and of lesson plans to identify “intended beliefs”; from the analysis, we developed a description of teaching and learning beliefs such as Autonomy & Curiosity and Develop Scientific Skills. The professed and intended beliefs of the participants formed connected clusters. We also found cases where these beliefs conflicted conceptually (e.g., when deciding to include many or fewer practices in each lesson or if the science practices are unique to science or can be applied generally). Our findings suggest that teacher educators need to be aware of more than just the professed beliefs of their preservice teachers. They should look for evidence of these beliefs in preservice teachers' intentions as well.",,,,"Bennion, Adam and Davis, Elizabeth A.",10.1080/1046560X.2022.2130258,,,15731847,Journal of Science Teacher Education,"Elementary preservice teachers,longitudinal,science practices,teacher beliefs,teaching and learning",6,645--666,,Routledge,{Connecting the Science Practices to Teaching and Learning: Preservice Elementary Teachers' Professed and Intended Beliefs},https://doi.org/10.1080/1046560X.2022.2130258,34,2023

The objective of this study is to examine methods for fostering artistic and creative skills among students within the framework of multicultural education through the use of graphics tablets. The authors conducted a four-month training program focused on drawing skills using graphics tablets, which involved studying the culture of China, Asian, and European countries through various art forms, as well as the basics of color science. Upon completion of the course, the authors found that 89% of children and 84% of parents responded positively to this type of training, as it allowed the children to effectively master drawing. However, there were certain technical skills gaps, such as a lack of accuracy in drawing angles, too large or too small drawings, and a lack of accuracy in drawing lines to given points. These gaps were eliminated as a result of studying additionally developed recommendations. The practical significance of this study lies in the search for effective mechanisms to develop drawing skills using graphics tablets in preschool education.",,,,"Yaling, Ma and E, Ma",10.1080/10494820.2024.2412084,,,17445191,Interactive Learning Environments,"Basics of color science,Preschoolers,culture,detail drawing,digitalization,personalized learning",0,1--12,,Routledge,{The role of graphics tablets in the development of artistic and creative abilities of preschool children in multicultural education},https://doi.org/10.1080/10494820.2024.2412084,0,2024
article,Greenfield2024,"Worldwide, there is growing recognition of the importance of science in early childhood education. Doing science' or, more formally, science and engineering practices, is acknowledged as a critical component of early science education that requires support from the adults in children's lives. Moreover, engaging in science practices helps build the foundations for active learning, problem-solving, and school readiness. Despite increased efforts to increase science in preschool classrooms the dearth of measurement tools restricts the ability of researchers to evaluate the efficacy of these efforts. This paper evaluates a new measure to assess preschool teachers' science and engineering practices across multiple classroom contexts throughout the day. Data from 58 preschool teachers and 360 children demonstrate the reliability of the EC-SPOT in capturing teachers' practices and validity evidence in relation to an external measure of children's science knowledge as well as the sensitivity to intervention effects. The EC-SPOT critically expands the ability to capture science learning beyond typically limited formal science lessons, as it unfolds naturally and often in preschool children's everyday classroom experiences. Both for evaluating and promoting higher quality science education in preschool programmes, the field needs better ways of capturing how adults recognise and encourage young children behaving as scientists.",,,,"Greenfield, Daryl and Zan, Betty and McWayne, Christine and Harris, Michael and Alexander, Alexandra and Ochoa, Wendy and Mistry, Jayanthi",10.1080/09500693.2024.2305634,,,14645289,International Journal of Science Education,"Assessment,early years/early childhood,professional development",0,1--19,,Routledge,{Early childhood science practices observation tool (EC-SPOT): assessing science practices across multiple classroom contexts},https://doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2024.2305634,0,2024

article,Park2013,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the inquiry features demonstrated in the inquiry tasks of a high school Earth Science curriculum. One of the most widely used curricula, Holt Earth Science, was chosen for this case study to examine how Earth Science logical reasoning and authentic scientific inquiry were related to one another and how they were reflected in the curriculum. The framework for data collection and analysis used in this case study included logical reasoning, hermeneutics, and historical method, and authentic inquiry. Two raters validated the framework's adoption in this study, looking at the content validity and reliability after the training. Each rater rated the sample curriculum independently and compared results to see if or how they agreed and disagreed. This process included questions, discussions, and clarifications about items of each framework. For inquiry tasks, results showed that induction (37.6%) and abduction (47.7%) were mainly used for logical reasoning; in hermeneutics, the process termed ""forestructures of understanding"" (82.7%) was mainly used, and ""recursive reasoning"" (12.0%) and the ""historical nature of human understanding"" (5.3%) were minimally used; and in the historical method, ""adhering to the modern principle of uniformitarianism"" (48.8%) and ""constructing proper taxonomies"" (34.2%) were mainly used. However, the curriculum included little use of what is typically represented, in high school Earth Science, as the features of authentic scientific inquiry. These features are ""making multiple observations"" and ""developing theories about mechanisms.""

article,So2023,"Background: STEM education and research are increasingly emphasized by governments worldwide to foster national development and productivity, economic competitiveness and societal wellbeing. There is no exception in Hong Kong, with its desire to promote STEM education and to strengthen Innovation and Technology development in the future. Purpose: This study aimed to explore the STEM activities employed in primary students' STEM projects under the theme ‘Living in a Smart City', and to identify what and how computation technologies were generally used and to examine the differences of computation technology used among project types and award levels. Sample: 168 project reports were collected from a STEM Fair with the following areas of content: the origins of the inquiry idea; scientific/STEM theories employed; inquiry process and testing methods implemented; findings and results obtained; difficulties encountered; and students' reflections. Design and methods: Content analysis on project reports and students' reflections was performed. The qualitative data were coded for statistical analysis, to explore the differences in the association of the STEM activities in the projects. Analyses were supported by students' reflections in the reports to explore students' computation experiences. Results: Most students worked on new device projects, and projects producing new devices were more likely to integrate technological activities. On the whole, science, engineering and mathematics activities complemented each other well, with less evidence of integration with respect to technology activities. Students gained valuable knowledge and got a sense of achievement from the STEM project work. Conclusion: It is encouraging to find that students were capable of integrating STEM activities to different extents into STEM projects. It is noticed that more emphasis should be laid on promoting the infusion of computation technological activities.

article,Caswell2018,"This article introduces an exploratory computational approach to extending the realm of automated journalism from simple descriptions to richer and more complex event-­driven narratives, based on original applied research in structured journalism. The practice of automated journalism is reviewed and a major constraint on the potential to automate journalistic writing is identified, namely the absence of data models sufficient to encode the journalistic knowledge necessary for automatically writing event-driven narratives. A detailed proposal addressing this constraint is presented, based on the representation of journalistic knowledge as structured event and structured narrative data. We describe a prototyped database of structured events and narratives, and introduce two methods of using event and narrative data from the prototyped database to provide journalistic knowledge to a commercial automated writing platform. Detailed examples of the use of each method are provided, including a successful application of the approach to stories about car chases, from initial data reporting through to automatically generated text. A framework for evaluating automatically generated event-driven narratives is proposed, several technical and editorial challenges to applying the approach in practice are discussed, and several high-level conclusions about the importance of data structures in automated journalism workflows are provided.",,,,"Caswell, David and D{\""{o}}rr, Konstantin",10.1080/17512786.2017.1320773,,,17512794,Journalism Practice,"automated journalism,computational journalism,computational narrative,data journalism,natural language generation,structured events,structured journalism,structured narratives",4,477--496,,Routledge,{Automated Journalism 2.0: Event-driven narratives: From simple descriptions to real stories},https://doi.org/10.1080/17512786.2017.1320773,12,2018
article,Phelps2017,"Business analytics continues to become increasingly important in business and therefore in business education. We surveyed faculty who teach statistics or whose institutions offer statistics to business students and conducted web searches of business analytics and data science programs that are offered by these faculties associated with schools of business. The intent of the survey and web searches was to gain insight on the current landscape of business analytics and how it may work synergistically with data science at institutions of higher education, as well as inform the role that statistics education plays in the era of big data. The study presents an analysis of subject areas (Statistics, Operations Research, Management Information Systems, Data Analytics, and Soft Skills) covered in courses offered by institutions with undergraduate degrees in business analytics or data science influencing statistics taught to business students. Given the notable contribution of statistics to the study of business analytics and data science and the importance of knowledge and skills acquired in statistics-based courses not only for students pursuing a major or minor in the discipline, but also for all business majors entering the current data-centric business environment, we present findings about who is teaching what in business statistics education.",,,,"Phelps, Amy L. and Szabat, Kathryn A.",10.1080/00031305.2016.1277160,,,15372731,American Statistician,"Analytics,Big data,Statistics education",2,155--161,,ASA Website,{The Current Landscape of Teaching Analytics to Business Students at Institutions of Higher Education: Who is Teaching What?},https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2016.1277160,71,2017

article,Bowlick2018,"The debate regarding geographic information systems (GIS) as tool, toolbox, or science still lingers in geography departments and among geographers. Analysis of geographic information is a vital component of decision making among business, governments, researchers, and academics. GIS users, geographers and nongeographers alike, use and benefit from problem-solving methods in numerous fields and contexts, making the use of GIS and the core competencies associated with using GIS a topic of intense debate. Complicating this ongoing discussion is the rise of data-centric approaches to research in geography that further expand the capabilities of spatial analysis and add to the expected knowledge of a GIS user and analyst. Building on a panel discussion at the 2016 American Association of Geographers (AAG) annual meeting, as well as informal dialogues on Twitter and other social media platforms that navigate this issue in academics and industry, this article explores how skills in research computing and programming operate in geography and GIS, especially given the rise of data-centric approaches to research in these realms.

article,Hernandez-Zavaleta2023,"Research on geometric transformations suggests that early learners possess intuitive understandings grounded in motion metaphors, transitioning to mappings.

Design features of block-based programming environments provide affordances to support hybridizing by providing a co-action space for learning. We conducted a comparative case study of four grade seven and eight students working in a Scratch task (Code the Quilts) and a game (Transformations Quest) to construct understandings of geometric transformations.

article,Williamson2019,"Education policy increasingly takes place across borders and sectors, involving a variety of both human and nonhuman actors. This comparative policy paper traces the ‘policy mobilities,' ‘fast policy' processes and distributed ‘policy assemblages' that have led to the introduction of new computer programming practices into schools and curricula in England, Sweden and Australia. Across the three contexts, government advisors and ministers, venture capital firms, think tanks and philanthropic foundations, non-profit organizations and commercial companies alike have promoted computer programming in schools according to a variety of purposes, aspirations, and commitments. This paper maps and traces the evolution of the organizational networks in each country in order to provide a comparative analysis of computing in schools as an exemplar of accelerated, transnationalizing policy mobility. The analysis demonstrates how computing in schools policy has been assembled through considerable effort to create alignments between diverse actors, the production and circulation of material objects, significant cross-border movement of ideas, people and devices, and the creation of strategic partnerships between government centres and commercial vendors. Computing in schools exemplifies how modern education policy and governance is accomplished through sprawling assemblages of actors, events, materials, money and technologies that move across social, governmental and geographical boundaries.",,,,"Williamson, Ben and {Bergviken Rensfeldt}, Annika and Player-Koro, Catarina and Selwyn, Neil",10.1080/02680939.2018.1476735,,,14645106,Journal of Education Policy,"Code,computing,curriculum,fast policy,policy mobilities,programming",5,705--725,,Routledge,{Education recoded: policy mobilities in the international ‘learning to code' agenda},https://doi.org/10.1080/02680939.2018.1476735,34,2019

The aims of this study were three-fold: 1) identify which SEPs teachers enacted during classroom instruction at the start and end of the PD; 2) explore the ways in which the SEPs were enacted; and 3) explore trends in self-efficacy and confidence of teaching the NGSS SEPs at mid and end points of the PD compared to the start of the program. Analysis of classroom observations revealed that, at time 2 (end of PD), teachers tended to incorporate more of the practices into instruction, with the greatest increase experienced by SEP 7 Engaging in Argumentation. Students also played a more active role in enacting each practice. Classroom observations revealed that, at both time 1 and time 2, teachers successfully utilized both general and SEP-specific scaffolds to support student enactment. Moreover, rather than teaching each practice in isolation, teachers integrated practices together to reach their lesson objective. While students were able to successfully enact most of the practices, they tended to struggle with specific aspects of argumentation and explanation.

Different approaches to the use of computation within journalism are then positioned as specific instances of that practice. This conception, analogous to “semantic unit” paradigms currently emerging in other information-centric domains, is then used to reinterpret several of journalism's urgent problems. A research agenda for developing computational journalism as an editorial activity within an increasingly data-centric communication environment is proposed, and several implications of the conception are discussed.",,,,"Caswell, David",10.1080/21670811.2019.1651665,,,2167082X,Digital Journalism,"Computational journalism,algorithmic journalism,automated journalism,knowledge representation,quantitative journalism,semantic representation,structured journalism,structured stories",8,1134--1156,,Routledge,{Structured Journalism and the Semantic Units of News},https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2019.1651665,7,2019
article,Steinberg2024,"This paper considers how a curricular design that integrated computer programming and creative movement shaped students' engagement with computing. We draw on data from a camp for middle schoolers, focusing on an activity in which students used the programming environment NetLogo to re-represent their physical choreography. We analyze the extent to which students noticed incompatibilities (mismatches between possibilities in dance and NetLogo), and how encountering them shaped their coding. Our findings suggest that as students attended to incompatibilities, they experienced struggle, but persisted and engaged in iterative cycles of design.

article,McNamara2019,"In the 1990s, statisticians began thinking in a principled way about how computation could better support the learning and doing of statistics. Since then, the pace of software development has accelerated, advancements in computing and data science have moved the goalposts, and it is time to reassess. Software continues to be developed to help do and learn statistics, but there is little critical evaluation of the resulting tools, and no accepted framework with which to critique them. This article presents a set of attributes necessary for a modern statistical computing tool. The framework was designed to be broadly applicable to both novice and expert users, with a particular focus on making more supportive statistical computing environments. A modern statistical computing tool should be accessible, provide easy entry, privilege data as a first-order object, support exploratory and confirmatory analysis, allow for flexible plot creation, support randomization, be interactive, include inherent documentation, support narrative, publishing, and reproducibility, and be flexible to extensions. Ideally, all these attributes could be incorporated into one tool, supporting users at all levels, but a more reasonable goal is for tools designed for novices and professionals to “reach across the gap,” taking inspiration from each others' strengths.",,arXiv,1610.00985,"McNamara, Amelia",10.1080/00031305.2018.1482784,,1610.00985,15372731,American Statistician,"Bootstrap,Data visualization,Exploratory data analysis,Randomization,Reproducibility,Software design,Software evaluation",4,375--384,,ASA Website,{Key Attributes of a Modern Statistical Computing Tool},https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2018.1482784,73,2019

This paper outlines a systematic literature review that investigated gaps in the current framing of data and faculty development, and explores how these gaps prevent the formulation of potential pathways and principles for fostering educators' data literacy. The analysis of 137 papers through classification by relevant categories and key word mapping shows that there is little attention on higher education teachers. It also makes clear that most approaches to educators' data literacy address management and technical abilities, with less emphasis on critical, ethical and personal approaches to datafication in education.

article,Price2023,"The epistemic components of science are included in instruction through the three-dimensional learning of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Students use the Science & Engineering Practices to engage the Disciplinary Core Ideas through the perspective of the Crosscutting Concepts. The NGSS focus on the epistemic aspects that all sciences share, but the domain-specific epistemic aspects, referred to here as ways of knowing, are still important to include in science education because they require different pedagogical methods. In this paper, I show how curriculum developers can incorporate the ways of knowing of the Earth & Space Sciences into their units through the choice of Practices and Crosscutting Concepts in the lesson-specific learning performance statements. I start by identifying the most common Practice-Crosscutting Concept pairs of the Earth & Space Sciences performance expectations and comparing them to the literature on the ways of knowing in the geosciences. The performance expectations represent the multiple modes of inquiry and systems thinking characteristic of the Earth & Space Sciences. Yet, they don't effectively represent other aspects of the Earth & Space Sciences, like visualization, spatial reasoning, deep time, and large size and spatial scales. I then encourage curriculum developers to move beyond the example of the performance expectations by providing suggested Practice and Crosscutting Concept pairs and groupings that can be used by curriculum developers to communicate these other aspects.

article,Murai2023,"Cultivating children's creativity and imagination is fundamental to preparing them for an increasingly complex and uncertain future. Engaging in creative learning enables children to think independently and critically, work cooperatively, and take risks while actively engaged in meaningful projects. While current trends in education, such as maker movements and computer science education, are dramatically expanding children's opportunities for engagement in creative learning, comparatively few empirical studies explore how creative learning can be integrated into elementary school curricula. In this paper, we investigated five key design strategies for integrating creative learning in school curricula through computer programming activities. The five design strategies, drawn from design meetings with in-service teachers and two pilot studies, comprise (1) prepare an object-to-think-with for specific curricular ideas, (2) find a context that provokes a leap of ideas within a disciplinary framework, (3) facilitate tinkering through disciplinary inquiry, (4) pair students and establishing developer and researcher roles, and (5) provide feedback to connect computer programming projects to disciplinary ideas. Implementing these strategies with mixed-method analysis indicated positive support for the efficacy of these design strategies.

The questions relate to the relevance of AI-informed scientific practices for science curriculum, teaching and teacher education at the secondary level.

article,Nikolic2023,"ChatGPT, a sophisticated online chatbot, sent shockwaves through many sectors once reports filtered through that it could pass exams. In higher education, it has raised many questions about the authenticity of assessment and challenges in detecting plagiarism. Amongst the resulting frenetic hubbub, hints of potential opportunities in how ChatGPT could support learning and the development of critical thinking have also emerged. In this paper, we examine how ChatGPT may affect assessment in engineering education by exploring ChatGPT responses to existing assessment prompts from ten subjects across seven Australian universities. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of current assessment practice and discuss opportunities on how ChatGPT can be used to facilitate learning. As artificial intelligence is rapidly improving, this analysis sets a benchmark for ChatGPT's performance as of early 2023 in responding to engineering education assessment prompts. ChatGPT did pass some subjects and excelled with some assessment types. Findings suggest that changes in current practice are needed, as typically with little modification to the input prompts, ChatGPT could generate passable responses to many of the assessments, and it is only going to get better as future versions are trained on larger data sets.",,,,"Nikolic, Sasha and Daniel, Scott and Haque, Rezwanul and Belkina, Marina and Hassan, Ghulam M. and Grundy, Sarah and Lyden, Sarah and Neal, Peter and Sandison, Caz",10.1080/03043797.2023.2213169,,,14695898,European Journal of Engineering Education,"Artificial intelligence (AI),ChatGPT,GPT-3,assessment,engineering education,integrity",4,559--614,,Taylor & Francis,{ChatGPT versus engineering education assessment: a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional benchmarking and analysis of this generative artificial intelligence tool to investigate assessment integrity},https://doi.org/10.1080/03043797.2023.2213169,48,2023

article,Wilson2019,"To become scientifically literate, students need to interpret science concepts using numbers, text, and visuals (Lemke 2004). Scientists use multiple modes to communicate their ideas to each other and the public, including images, text, mathematical notations, symbols, diagrams, charts, and graphs. Several of the science and engineering practices in the ""Next Generation Science Standards"" (NGSS Lead States 2013) incorporate multiple modes of representing information: developing and using models; analyzing and interpreting data; using mathematical and computational thinking; and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating data. In addition, using multiple modes in science instruction allows teachers to integrate other subject skills within a science unit, such as English language arts standards for reading, writing, and speaking and mathematics standards for numbers and operations and measurement and data. When other subject skills are integrated, science becomes more relevant for students. Furthermore, having facility with multiple modes of representation in science instruction benefits student learning and increases their depth of understanding (Wilson and Bradbury 2016).

article,Hu2024,"The application of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) education in solving real-world problems is challenging. To tackle this challenge, a project-based learning approach that integrates robots with cost-effective self-made toys to problem-solving was adopted to assist rural primary school students to apply STEM skills. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the project-based learning approach which includes lecturing and hands-on activities on primary school students' STEM learning outcomes and attitudes. An experiment was conducted with 25 primary school students who voluntarily participated in a STEM summer-camp programme. Students were asked to assemble a paper house equipped with an IoT control module and LED light switches, and write and edit robot scripts to produce a robot-based storytelling narrative using the paper house they made as a context. The results show that the project-based learning approach was an effective approach for cultivating primary school students' STEM knowledge and skills as evidenced from the post-written test. The relationships between the students' STEM learning outcomes and attitudes were also confirmed by a clustering analysis. Students who had higher learning attitudes also achieved higher STEM learning outcomes; the findings are also supported by the feedback from the open-ended questionnaire items.

article,Harlow2018,"This article integrates an ecological approach and design-based research in computer science education research by following the simultaneous development of a computer programming environment and curriculum for elementary school age children over 2-1/2 years.

We used the computer science concept of initializing as a tracer idea and both qualitative and quantitative data to identify mismatches between the affordances provided by our programming environment and the learners' effectivities. These included requisite mathematical skills, confusion between resetting and setting up, and incorrectly assuming that features of the programming environment conveyed information. We then describe how we addressed the mismatches by removing or adding functionality to the programming environment, adding signifiers, adapting the curriculum to include scaffolding related to the effectivities, or removing activities.",,,,"Harlow, Danielle B. and Dwyer, Hilary A. and Hansen, Alexandria K. and Iveland, Ashley O. and Franklin, Diana M.",10.1080/07370008.2018.1475390,,,07370008,Cognition and Instruction,,3,224--246,,Routledge,{Ecological Design-Based Research for Computer Science Education: Affordances and Effectivities for Elementary School Students},https://doi.org/10.1080/07370008.2018.1475390,36,2018
article,Navarro-Cota2024,"The demand for programmers has grown exponentially in recent years, making programming an indispensable skill. However, the complex nature of programming poses various challenges for novice programmers, leading to high dropout rates in programming courses. The recognition of individual differences, encompassing distinct neurocognitive profiles, is acknowledged to influence the accuracy of predicting programming skill outcomes. As a result, an increasing awareness exists regarding the substantial contribution of human factors, including personality or cognitive ability, to programming performance. This study conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to explore recent research on individual differentiation or programmer profiling in programming tasks. The primary goal is to examine pertinent research exploring personal characteristics' influence on programming in various contexts. As a result of this review, a taxonomy has been introduced to enhance the comprehension of programmers' multifaceted individual differences, categorising influential factors into nine distinct dimensions. Furthermore, it has been found that individual differences influence performance in programming tasks, as well as in the learning of this discipline. In conclusion, this SLR emphasises human factors' critical role in programming and proposes a taxonomy that is a valuable framework for researchers, educators, and practitioners to enhance their understanding of human factors' influence on programming performance.",,,,"Navarro-Cota, Christian and Molina, Ana I. and Redondo, Miguel A. and Lacave, Carmen",10.1080/0144929X.2024.2317377,,,13623001,Behaviour and Information Technology,"Programming,human factors,individual differences,systematic literature review",0,1--19,,Taylor & Francis,{Individual differences in computer programming: a systematic review},https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2024.2317377,0,2024
article,Lee2020,"Concerning the underrepresentation of female students in computer science (CS) classes at the K-12 level and math-intensive STEM fields, this study investigated the relationship between female students earning less credits in CS courses during high school and their STEM major choices. Data were drawn from a nationally representative sample of U.S. high school graduates from the restricted data of the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 which were collected by the National Center for Educational Statistics. The multilevel structural equation modeling revealed that (a) female students' lower frequency of taking CS courses was associated significantly with their underrepresentation in STEM fields, (b) earning less credits in CS courses was a stronger factor for female students' underrepresentation in STEM fields compared to the well-documented predictors for STEM major choice—math self-efficacy and math scores on the ACT, and (c) no significant difference in ACT math scores emerged between male and female students, which challenges the dominant view that male students' greater math aptitude causes the persistent gender gap that leads to women's underrepresentation in STEM fields. The study suggests that integrating CS in traditional classrooms as well as promoting a rigorous CS curriculum at the secondary level would be an effective strategy to increase female participation in math-intensive STEM fields.",,,,"Lee, Ahlam",10.1080/07380569.2020.1720553,,,15287033,Computers in the Schools,"Computer science education,gender,multilevel structural equation modeling,postsecondary institutions,stem",1,17--39,,Routledge,{The Association Between Female Students' Computer Science Education and STEM Major Selection: Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling},https://doi.org/10.1080/07380569.2020.1720553,37,2020
article,Osborne2014,"This paper provides a rationale for the changes advocated by the Framework for K-12 Science Education and the Next Generation Science Standards. It provides an argument for why the model embedded in the Next Generation Science Standards is seen as an improvement. The Case made here is that the underlying model that the new Framework presents of science better represents contemporary understanding of nature of science as a social and cultural practice. Second, it argues that the adopting a framework of practices will enable better communication of meaning amongst professional science educators. This, in turn, will enable practice in the classroom to improve.

This research developed a framework of an alternate reality-based board game incorporating augmented reality (AR) exploration with multi-dimensional scaffolding, including cognitive scaffolding, metacognitive scaffolding, and peer scaffolding. Features included alternate reality games, board games, and AR technology. An educational alternate reality game Lost in Space based on the above framework was developed, and scaffolding was designed to help players focus on spatial and logical thinking. Participants were 127 tenth-grade students from northern Taiwan. Empirical analysis was conducted with the aim of exploring the learners' learning outcomes, flow state, and perceptions of the multi-dimensional scaffolding as well as its usefulness. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the learning achievement of the students in the experimental group (using game learning) and the control group (using general teaching materials). However, students in the experimental group showed significant improvement in learning achievement after the game, while students in the control group showed no significant improvement in learning achievement.

Although it was initially intended for K-12 students, educators have used it for higher education as well, and found it particularly helpful for those who haven't had the privilege of learning coding before college. In this article, we propose using SCRATCH to create an interactive and fun project for introduction as a gateway to learn R in introductory or intermediate statistics courses. We begin with a literature review on recent K-12 computing education, as well as how visual coding has been used in college classrooms as an aid for teaching syntax-based coding. Then, we explain the design of the proposed project and share the observations from a pilot study in a liberal arts college with 39 students who had diverse coding experiences. We find that the most disadvantaged students are not those with no coding experience, but those with poor prior coding experience or with low coding self-efficacy.

We report the following findings: 1) Three types of rules between design units were identified with visual artifact analysis: latent, generic, and domain-specific rules; 2) two types of CSCL artifacts (technology and discussions) were intertwined and developed in parallel, along with a computer-based scaffolding scenario that offloads domain-specific scaffolding from humans to computers.",,,,"Andersen, Renate and M{\o}rch, Anders I. and Litherland, Kristina Torine",10.1080/0144929X.2022.2083981,,,13623001,Behaviour and Information Technology,"Block-based programming,computer-supported collaborative learning,domain-oriented design environment,human-centered artificial intelligence,knowledge-based rules,physical computing in education",9,1830--1847,,Taylor & Francis,{Collaborative learning with block-based programming: investigating human-centered artificial intelligence in education},https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2022.2083981,41,2022
article,Sun2023,"Coding ability has become an essential digital skill for young children. The graphical programming environment is valuable carrier for cultivating children's coding ability. The purpose of this study is to develop a coding ability test for children, to conduct a graphic coding intervention, and to further explore the impact of multiple factors on children's coding ability in ScratchJr intervention. First, the coding ability test for ScratchJr environment was developed based on Item Response Theory to measure kindergarten students' coding ability. The result showed that there are good reliability, content, and structural validity of the test question. Secondly, we conducted a 12-week ScratchJr coding activity teaching experiment on 162 kindergarten students. The analysis of the treated group and the control group showed that coding activity teaching can effectively improve the students' coding ability. Finally, this study analyzed the differences in children's coding ability in coding interest, and coding experience. The results showed that the coding ability was affected by coding experience and coding interest. More interestingly, it was found partial mediation effect among coding ability, coding experience and coding interest.

article,Weinburgh2021,"The purpose of this study was to understand how biology teachers experienced and learned from professional development (PD) in which the 5R Instructional Model was used as a framework for planning inclusive lesson for emerging multilingual learners (EML). The PD integrated biology content with the scientific practices of using mathematical thinking and multimodal communication strategies to help EMLs. A case study was used to answer (1) How do biology teachers describe their personal PD experience of learning about science communication as multimodal language? And (2) how do biology teachers articulate their use of multimodal language during instructions using the 5R Instructional Model? Thirty-four biology teachers participated for two years. Data from three sources were analyzed using two phases of a priori and one phase of en vivo coding. Three themes emerged (removing the blindfold, vocabulary, and experiencing the Rs) as descriptors of the learning experience (Q1).

article,Lachney2017,"Bridging schools and communities has been a goal, if not hurdle, for reformers who aim to improve the education of low-income and underrepresented students from the bottom-up. Strategies to create these connections are often characterized as ‘brokerage', where individuals or organizations bridge two or more social worlds. This paper details the design and implementation of educational technologies that support the brokering of school–community connections using a ‘culturally responsive computing' (CRC) framework. Culturally responsive education is often limited to content and learning styles, which misses the opportunities it creates for a brokerage process that also connects to education-based social movements for economic access in underrepresented communities.

It allows schools and communities to build assets together, translating the knowledge and skills of underrepresented communities into math and computing education, while illuminating the ways in which technologies can motivate education-based social movement building.",,,,"Lachney, Michael",10.1080/17439884.2016.1211679,,,17439892,"Learning, Media and Technology","Brokerage,cultural capital,culturally responsive computing,ethnocomputing,social movements",4,420--439,,Routledge,{Culturally responsive computing as brokerage: toward asset building with education-based social movements},https://doi.org/10.1080/17439884.2016.1211679,42,2017
article,Tran2024,"Although student teaching plays a crucial role in teacher preparation programs, limited research has examined the specific features of this experience that positively impact preservice science teachers' (PSTs) questioning competency. This multi-case study contributes to the existing body of research by presenting findings from an initiative in a teacher preparation program that integrates self-regulated learning (SRL) into professional learning (PL) and coaching to improve PSTs' questioning skills. Despite variability in their initial SRL skills, all participating PSTs experiened shared learning opportunities related to asking higher-level cognitive questions. The PL and coaching during student teaching appeared to contribute to PSTs' improvement in different aspects of asking questions. Coaching, in particular, enhanced PSTs' application of strategies learned in the PL and facilitated learning from the act of teaching. The findings suggest that to help PSTs develop to ask higher-level cognitive questions, teacher preparation programs need to provide detailed, memorable, and theory-grounded descriptions of questioning techniques.

article,Domenach2021,"This discussion examines the ever-increasing impact of top-down nation-wide educational reforms on teachers in Japan, exemplified in the 2020 reform. Its unique contribution is a suggestion of an interdisciplinary framework: programming education and English as a foreign language education in elementary schools. Many elementary school teachers are not specialists in computer programming or English education as discipline specialties, yet they face the obligation to teach both subject areas under the authority of the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology. Their lack of training in these curricular areas creates a high level of anxiety as they initially perceived daunting new challenges in their work performances. Concerning programming education, many teachers are not even digital natives, working in schools where “IT rooms [are] covered with dust”. The research highlighted here resulted from the authors' engagement in professional development workshops for teachers, Integrated Programming English Education, demonstrating how much these two disciplines share commonalities and how teachers can effectively use them in their daily teaching.

We found that the majority of studies focused on teaching coding and academic content through game making, and that few studies explicitly examined the roles of collaboration and identity in the game making process. We argue that future discussions of serious gaming ought to be more inclusive of constructionist approaches to realize the full potential of serious gaming.

article,Appel2019,"As librarians are developing library instruction curricula for map and geography libraries, there are many places where one can find guidance. Instructional frameworks can help organize and teach key competencies and develop literacy of geospatial information for learners. The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education has become the quintessential guiding document for information literacy instruction in academic libraries. One does not teach the framework directly, rather the instructor (librarian) identifies threshold concepts, knowledge practices, and dispositions guided by six core concepts and disciplinary context. Librarians in special collections must consider how to apply such frameworks to specific disciplines, collections, institutions, and curricula. This paper focuses on geospatial information literacy instruction, best represented by librarians offering instruction services on geospatial data and/or technologies to classes ranging from GIScience courses to humanities classes incorporating digital scholarship.

article,Kjallander2018,"For education to provide knowledge reflecting our current and future society, many countries are revising their curricula, including a vivid discussion on digital competence, programming and computational thinking. This article builds an understanding of the maker movement in relation to education in programming, by demonstrating challenges and possibilities in the interface between Makerspaces and teacher education. Three different Nordic initiatives are presented and their designs for learning are analysed. The article illustrates how Makerspaces and teacher education can be transformed by each other; how Makerspaces can be used in programming activities and what challenges and possibilities emerge in the meeting between the two. The results highlight a core aspect of the maker movement: authenticity. Designs for learning have different levels of authenticity, but in all cases authenticity has been a positive factor. These hands-on learning environments are designed to foster collaboration, share ideas and innovation with people from different backgrounds to transform and form multimodal representations together. In the interface between the formal and informal a potential for inclusion and creation of spaces that reach individuals from different backgrounds is found. Mobile learning is a phenomenon that the making movement together with teacher education can make use of, at for example practice schools, university campuses, mobile Makerspaces or “open-door”-approaches.

article,Kang2018,"The aim of this study was to assess elementary teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of and confidence in their ability to support students in enacting the science and engineering practices (SEPs) of the Next Generation Science Standards. Findings from this study were used to inform the planning of a professional development program for these teachers. This was a mixed-methods analysis of teachers' responses to a survey that included self-assessment ratings of their knowledge and confidence as well as open-ended questions about how students enact the SEPs in class. Responses detailing how students could enact SEPs were used to ascertain teachers' PCK via a modified novice–expert scale as well as coded for examples of PCK. Findings from the self-report portion revealed remarkable consistency between teachers' ratings of their perceptions of knowledge and confidence: The highest score was in SEP 4 (analyzing and interpreting data) and the lowest score was in SEP 5 (using mathematics and computational thinking) for both knowledge and confidence. Results from the open-ended questions showed that most teachers' examples were scored as competent on the components of PCK assessed.

article,Masters2022,"A mixed-methods, quasi-experimental design was employed to explore how the Claim, Evidence, and Reasoning (CER) framework along with written, verbal, and peer scaffolds would influence early childhood/elementary and elementary/middle childhood preservice teachers' (PSTs) abilities to formulate scientific explanations within a physical science course for educators. Two sections served as the intervention group and learned how to construct scientific explanations with the supports described above. Two additional sections served as the comparison group and received no additional support for how to construct explanations in science. Five pre/post scientific explanations, five scientific explanation quiz questions, five scientific explanation journal entries, and five self-reflections were collected and analyzed to address the research questions. From our results, we can conclude that the CER framework along with the fading of scaffolds can assist PSTs with learning how to construct scientific explanations. There was a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparison groups' abilities to provide sufficient evidence to support their claim and justify their claim and evidence with scientific reasoning across all data sources. The results also show the intervention groups' ability to form a scientific explanation was not influenced by the fading of the scaffolds; rather certain content areas were more challenging than others. Providing evidence that required mathematical and computational thinking was more challenging for both groups. Reasoning continued to be the most difficult component of an explanation for PSTs to construct. These findings have important implications for the design of science content courses for PSTs.",,,,"Masters, Heidi and Docktor, Jennifer",10.1080/1046560X.2021.2004641,,,15731847,Journal of Science Teacher Education,"Preservice teachers,physics,quasi-experimental,scientific explanations",7,786--813,,Routledge,{Preservice Teachers' Abilities and Confidence with Constructing Scientific Explanations as Scaffolds are Faded in a Physics Course for Educators},https://doi.org/10.1080/1046560X.2021.2004641,33,2022
article,Sadik2024,"Background and Context: Based on issues arising around how to best prepare CS teachers and the constantly changing nature of the CS education content, curriculum, and instructional methods, it is crucial to examine the needs of secondary CS teachers. Objective: The primary purpose of this study was to identify secondary computer science (CS) teachers' needs and make recommendations for future CS education research and practices in the U.S. Method: Using a mixed-method research design, the data were collected from Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA)'s email listserv member discussions (n = 1,706 from 482 unique members), questionnaire responses from 222 secondary CS teachers, and semi-structured interviews with eight CS teachers in the US. Findings: Updating curriculum resources was an important ongoing need for secondary CS teachers. Curriculum resources, materials to assess students learning, and embedding the principles of computational thinking into curriculum were reported as major needs for secondary teachers. Teachers also reported that they need to learn more about student-centered teaching strategies (e.g. problem-based learning and pair programming) and guide students' learning using scaffolding and team-management strategies. The findings suggest that teachers perceived the need for administrators', parents', and other CS teachers' support. Having an online community for teachers was critical to address their curricular and pedagogical needs. Furthermore, increasing student enrollment and interest in CS was critical for the future of CS education. Implications: The findings of this research have implications for creating professional development plans and support that can address secondary CS teachers' needs in the US.",,,,"Sadik, Olgun and Ottenbreit-Leftwich, Anne Todd",10.1080/08993408.2023.2209474,,,17445175,Computer Science Education,"Computer science education,curriculum,pedagogy,secondary education,student-centered,teachers' needs",2,252--284,,Routledge,{Understanding U.S. secondary computer science teachers' challenges and needs},https://doi.org/10.1080/08993408.2023.2209474,34,2024

article,Tankersley2024,"In the landscape of U.S. education, the widespread adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) offers a unique vantage point for researchers to better understand teacher-, school- and classroom-level factors that advance reform initiatives in science classrooms. Addressing a gap in current knowledge, our study probes how secondary science teachers implement one dimension of NGSS-the science practices (SPs). Our data collection encompasses teacher interviews and meticulous observations of science lessons, coded for NGSS science practices (SPs) and inquiry-based teaching. Embracing a methodologically rich approach, our study employs both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis. Quantitatively, we analyzed 801 weeks of lessons taught by 56 secondary science teachers and found patterns in SP use. Selected high-quality science lessons were then spotlighted, providing examples of the quantitative findings, showcasing teachers use of SPs and inquiry-based teaching strategies. Through our analysis, we found that physical science subjects and participants from the Master of Arts in Science Teaching program demonstrated a higher average use of SPs compared to their life science and undergraduate program counterparts. When analyzing the use of specific SPs, we found that analyzing and interpreting data (SP4) and mathematical and computational thinking (SP5) emerged as noteworthy. This study's findings carry implications for science teacher education and professional development programs, urging efforts to augment both the quantity of rigor of SP use in the secondary science classroom.

article,Kim2015,"Abstract This study examines diverse elementary students including English Language Learners (ELLs)' science achievements and attitude changes following inquiry-based activity experiences. Thirty seventh-grade students explored the harmful and helpful effects of ultraviolet (UV) rays on the human environment using scientific methods to define problems, develop models, plan and carry out investigations, analyze/interpret data, use mathematics and computational thinking, construct explanations (for science) and designing solutions (for engineering), engage in evidence-based arguments, and evaluate/communicate obtained information. These processes are known as inquiry-oriented approaches (NRC, 2000) and have been deepened and redefined as a set of eight science and engineering practices in the Next Generation of Science Standards (NRC, 2012). Individuals designed their own experiments by choosing different materials to test for the best protector of UV light. The Science exploration sheet (SES), which measured the scientific achievement, showed that 92% of students answered their own questions using their individual scientific models. However, pre- and post-attitude surveys revealed that there was no significant change in students' attitudes about science/scientists following the inquiry intervention (p< .05).

article,Wang2024b,"In order to cultivate children's computational thinking, researchers have developed many excellent programming systems. Among them, the tangible programming systems combined with graphic output have been widely accepted because of the intuitive input method and diversified visual feedback. However, few of them support collaborative learning or programming. Little is known about children's experiences, emotional states and behaviours on collaborative programming. Motivated by this gap, we present a novel tangible and collaborative enabled programming system named Lighters, which designed for children aged 7–10 and had two types of collaboration modes (block-based and role-based). We conducted an user experiment with 24 children, and collected physiological (EDA), questionnaire, video recording and interview data for analysis. Based on our experiment results, Lighters are effective in helping children learn to program collaboratively. In addition, Lighters can mobilize children's positive emotions and enthusiasm to learn programming.

The second half of the article details how labs promote the use of digital data analysis, evidence-based evaluation and ‘design-for-policy' techniques as methods for the governing of education. In particular, they promote the ‘computational thinking' associated with computer programming as a capacity required by a ‘reluctant state' that is increasingly concerned to delegate its responsibilities to digitally enabled citizens with the ‘designerly' capacities and technical expertise to ‘code' solutions to public and social problems. Policy innovation labs are experimental laboratories trialling new methods within education for administering and governing the future of the state itself.",,,,"Williamson, Ben",10.1080/00220620.2015.1038693,,,14787431,Journal of Educational Administration and History,"Data,Design,Digital,Governance,Innovation,Methods,Policy innovation labs,Technical expertise",3,251--271,,Routledge,"{Governing methods: Policy innovation labs, design and data science in the digital governance of education}",https://doi.org/10.1080/00220620.2015.1038693,47,2015
article,MelanderBowden2019,"This article explores children's development of problem-solving practices through multimodal engagements in digital activities. The study is based on analyses of a video recorded peer group activity in which two children, within the context of a project on computational thinking using the software Scratch, collaboratively work to solve a coding problem. Drawing on work on epistemics-in-interaction and the cooperative and transformative organization of human action and knowledge, the analyses focus on the interactional strategies that the children use to establish, sustain, and develop knowledge within the peer group and the role of affect in the unfolding organization of actions.

The first is community representation, using cultural capital to highlight students' social identities and networks through computational thinking. The second, computational integration, locates computation in cultural capital itself. I survey two risks–the appearance of shallow computing and the reproduction of assimilationist logics–that may arise when constructing one bridge without the other.

The objective of this study was to determine gaps in everyday science practices, and to eventually design interventions which might help teacher candidates relate all the NGSS science practices to their students' lives. The most common NGSS science practices documented were asking questions and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information. The least documented practices were analyzing and interpreting data and using mathematics and computational thinking. This assignment helped teacher candidates develop their identity as scientists, notice more science in their daily lives, and helped them bridge the gap from everyday applications of science to their classroom lessons.

article,Holo2023,"This review article focuses on the teaching of computer programming in primary school mathematics, as reported by 37 empirical studies. Our findings show that a variety of research methods are used, which often combine qualitative and quantitative approaches. Furthermore, we found the focus of attention to vary from emphasis on the teacher and the teacher's knowledge regarding computer programming, to how use of tools and devices can influence learning outcomes, and the actual teaching and learning in the classroom. We found the implications for teaching congregate in three categories: the relation between mathematics and computer programming, tools and devices, and didactical approaches. Based on the discussion of our findings, we suggest two new possibilities for research on the teaching of computer programming in primary school mathematics: focus on computer programming and specific mathematical topics, and focus on students' in-depth learning in a way that makes it possible to explore connections between computer programming and mathematics and use of computational thinking to solve mathematical problems.",,,,"Holo, O.

In this study, we examine whether pair programming is effective in K-12, what it is effective for, and how partners influence each other. We collected the data from 320 middle school students working alone or with a partner on a game programming task. Compared to working alone, pair programming was advantageous for computational thinking and for building programming knowledge, particularly among less experienced students. Students' initial computer experience and attitude toward collaboration influenced their partners. Those with more experience relative to their partner achieved greater computer confidence and more positive attitudes toward computing. When students had a more positive attitude toward collaboration (relative to their partner), their programming knowledge decreased.

article,Nita2023,"Background: Knowledge of quantum computing is arguably inaccessible to many, with knowledge of the complex mathematics involving a particular barrier to entry, creating difficulty in terms of teaching and inclusive learning for those without a high level of mathematics. Meanwhile, it is increasingly important that the knowledge of quantum technologies is accessible to those who work with real-world applications and is taught to the younger generation. Purpose: Resulting from collaborative dialogue between physicists, computer scientists, educationalists, and industrial end users, we propose the concept of quantum literacy as one means of addressing the need for transdisciplinary research in response to the complex problems that we see at the heart of issues around global sustainability. In this way, quantum literacy can contribute to UN Sustainable Development Goal 4, Quality Education. Methods: We introduce a specific puzzle visualization learning tool through which to achieve the pedagogic ends we set out with respect to quantum literacy. Visualization through puzzles can enable non-specialists to develop an intuitive, but still rigorous, understanding of universal quantum computation and provide a facility for non-specialists to discover increasingly complex and new quantum algorithms. Using the Hong–Ou–Mandel optical effect from quantum mechanics, we demonstrate how visual methods such as those made possible through the puzzle visualization tool can be very useful for understanding underlying complex processes in quantum physics and beyond and therefore support the aims of quantum literacy. Conclusion: We argue that quantum literacy, as defined here, addresses the challenges of learning within a highly bounded discipline and of access to the kind of powerful knowledge that should be more accessible to a wide group of learners. We therefore argue for the importance of addressing pedagogic issues when powerful knowledge consists of dense concepts, as well as complex and hierarchical relations between concepts, in addition to presenting a strong barrier to entry in the form of mathematics.",,arXiv,2004.07957,"Nita, Laurentiu and {Mazzoli Smith}, Laura and Chancellor, Nicholas and Cramman, Helen",10.1080/02635143.2021.1920905,,2004.07957,14701138,Research in Science and Technological Education,"Quantum literacy,games,mathematics,powerful knowledge,quantum computation",2,564--580,,Routledge,{The challenge and opportunities of quantum literacy for future education and transdisciplinary problem-solving},https://doi.org/10.1080/02635143.2021.1920905,41,2023

article,Liu2022a,"In this study, an interactive programming learning environment was built with two types of error prompt functions: 1) the key prompt and 2) step-by-step prompt. A quasi-experimental study was conducted for five weeks, in which 75 sixth grade students from disadvantaged learning environments in Taipei, Taiwan, were divided into three groups: 1) the key prompt group, 2) the step-by-step prompt group, and 3) the group in which teachers explained the errors. The aim was to investigate the effects of different interactive methods on students' learning in programming.

article,Sun2023a,"Background: With the rapid advancement of technology, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education has undergone significant transformations through the integration of various technologies. Studies are needed to provide a birds-eye view of the technology-oriented STEM education for identifying current status, development trends, and future directions. Purpose: This review aims to explore the characteristics of technology-oriented STEM education in primary and secondary schools, focusing on its status, regional contributions, subject domains, integration levels, outcomes, types of technologies, and research methods. Methods: To conduct this review study, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses method was utilized, leading to the identification of 127 empirical studies from databases and selected journals. Results and conclusion: The results, based on a combination of research methods, revealed a notable increase in empirical studies on technology-oriented STEM education. Among the STEM subjects, more than half of the studies emphasized the integration of a single STEM subject, with interdisciplinary integration being dominant. Engineering was observed to be the least integrated subject among the four STEM areas. Learning objectives in the studies emphasized 21st-century skills and STEM skills, while affective research mainly focused on interests, attitudes, and engagement. Student-centered learning, such as inquiry-based learning and game-based learning, along with engineering design, emerged as the most commonly adopted pedagogical approaches. In the realm of technology tools, computational tools were found to be widely embraced in technology-oriented STEM education. Notably, the majority of studies targeted students in upper primary and junior secondary schools, employing mixed research methods. These findings hold significant implications for the design and implementation of technology-oriented STEM education at primary and secondary school levels.",,,,"Sun, Daner and Zhan, Ying and Wan, Zhi Hong and Yang, Yuqin and Looi, Chee Kit",10.1080/02635143.2023.2251902,,,14701138,Research in Science and Technological Education,"Empirical studies,PRISMA,STEM education,primary and secondary levels,technologies",0,1--25,,Routledge,{Identifying the roles of technology: a systematic review of STEM education in primary and secondary schools from 2015 to 2023},https://doi.org/10.1080/02635143.2023.2251902,0,2023

article,Yoon2015,"Background: This exploratory study is part of a larger-scale research project aimed at building theoretical and practical knowledge of complex systems in students and teachers with the goal of improving high school biology learning through professional development and a classroom intervention. Purpose: We propose a model of adaptive expertise to better understand teachers' classroom practices as they attempt to navigate myriad variables in the implementation of biology units that include working with computer simulations, and learning about and teaching through complex systems ideas. Sample: Research participants were three high school biology teachers, two females and one male, ranging in teaching experience from six to 16 years. Their teaching contexts also ranged in student achievement from 14–47% advanced science proficiency. Design and methods: We used a holistic multiple case study methodology and collected data during the 2011–2012 school year. Data sources include classroom observations, teacher and student surveys, and interviews. Data analyses and trustworthiness measures were conducted through qualitative mining of data sources and triangulation of findings. Results: We illustrate the characteristics of adaptive expertise of more or less successful teaching and learning when implementing complex systems curricula.

article,He2024,"This article explores science teachers' implementation of science and engineering practices (SEPs) under different instructional settings. We compared the number of SEPs science teachers reported using in face-to-face instruction (traditional), online-only instruction (virtual), or HyFlex instruction (synchronously online and in-person) from August 2020 to May 2021. Records and artefacts of the teachers' instructional practices were collected over three one-week periods. Interview data were used to validate teachers' instructional activities, the context of SEP implementation, and their challenges when navigating the different instructional settings. Through a lens of consequential transition perspective, our findings revealed that science teachers implemented significantly more SEPs in a HyFlex or traditional setting than in a virtual setting. The results also showed that regardless of the instructional setting, elementary and secondary teachers generally implemented few investigating SEPs. Among elementary teachers, developing explanations and solutions were the most frequently used SEPs across all instructional settings. Among secondary teachers, the developing explanations and solutions SEPs and evaluating SEPs were prevalent but varied across the different instructional settings.

article,Christensen2024,"The computational thinking to learn sustainability learning progression aided in the development of a striper (Morone saxatilis) fishing project through standardized hook and line practices performed by students and researchers at a small liberal arts University in the Northeast United States. Computational thinking at a simple level supported the intersections of sustainability spheres (environmental and social) and problem-solving concepts (regulation, education and research) toward an interdisciplinary, literature-based framework. The objective of this project was the synthesis of new variables that contributed to Morone saxatilis catch efficiency through the assessment of relationships based on semi standardized angler logs in ways that are appealing and of service to both anglers and researchers as there is a need to bridge these stakeholder groups. The new variables of fish length, structural location, water body location, season, time of day, water temperature, moon phase, wind speed, wind direction and tide all showed some significance in that specific combinations resulted in higher probability of anglers catching striped bass. The findings define the overlap of variables of use to both communities and validate angler knowledge. We present new relationships of highest catch efficiency of our specific locale, including items such as larger fish tended to be caught at dusk, on bridges with low northwest wind during the fall. Implications of these findings provide a foundation of language and shared goals between recreational anglers and the scientific community particularly to support citizen science projects aimed at sustainable fisheries.

article,Alam2024,"The researchers developed an Integrated Constructive Robotics in Education (ICRE) model that represents a pioneering framework designed to revolutionize educational landscapes by integrating robotics into pedagogical settings. This research introduces the ICRE model, elucidating its multifaceted dimensions and envisioning its profound impact on educational paradigms. The ICRE model emerges as a comprehensive framework that amalgamates constructivist principles with robotics technology, fostering an environment conducive to active, experiential learning. Anchored in constructivist pedagogy, the model accentuates hands-on, immersive experiences where students engage in designing, programming, and manipulating robots. This tactile engagement not only stimulates curiosity but also empowers students to witness direct outcomes, cultivating a profound sense of agency and ownership in their learning journey. Central to the ICRE model is its versatility, catering to interdisciplinary activities that transcend conventional disciplinary boundaries. By nurturing a deeper conceptual understanding and honing higher-order cognitive skills within Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) subjects, the model serves as a catalyst for holistic development. The transformative potential of the ICRE model extends beyond technical skill acquisition, encapsulating motivational, cooperative, and creative dimensions. It addresses gender disparities within STEM education, endeavoring to mitigate gaps in interest and skills. Furthermore, the ICRE model emphasizes the importance of teacher training, equity in access, and collaboration between educators, researchers, and industry professionals.

article,Cheng2023,"Programming ability is the core ability of this era and can be obtained and improved through practice. In this paper, an Automated Programming Assessment system based on Mastery learning and Peer competition (APAMP) was proposed and developed. APAMP allows students to practice repeatedly by providing immediate feedback after their programs are submitted. It also presents an analytical dashboard as a competition mechanism for students to visualize their learning performance and compare their performance with peers. By incorporating APAMP into programming courses, students can master programming skills through repeated practice, and their enthusiasm for learning programming can also be encouraged by peer competition. To evaluate the effects of APAMP on the learning performance of students with programming language learning and novice students, a quasi-experiment was conducted in a high school. The experimental results showed that the learning achievement of the two groups of students improved significantly. Moreover, the learning attitude of students in the experienced group improved significantly, with the experienced students benefiting more from the system than the novice students. In fact, the novice students showed a significant decline in learning attitude and learning motivation, which was contrary to our intuition.",,,,"Cheng, Li Chen and Li, Wei and Tseng, Judy C.R.",10.1080/10494820.2021.2006237,,,17445191,Interactive Learning Environments,"Programming instruction,automated programming assessment systems,learning performance,mastery learning,peer competition",8,5347--5363,,Routledge,{Effects of an automated programming assessment system on the learning performances of experienced and novice learners},https://doi.org/10.1080/10494820.2021.2006237,31,2023

article,Mork2021,"Science teacher educators (STEs) have key roles in the educational system through their preparation of pre- and in-service science teachers and in implementing future-oriented policy reforms. Given the complexity and importance of their role, what types of knowledge do STEs need? STEs come from a range of backgrounds and there are few systematic routes for their ongoing learning. Hence, there is a need for tools that can help define and assess STEs' competence. The purpose of this theoretical paper is to highlight central knowledge domains for STEs. We draw on previous work and add perspectives from current trends in science education and teacher education to describe four knowledge domains for STEs: natural science, science education in school, science teacher education and science education research. The main contribution of the paper is an updated conceptualisation of the nature of STEs' knowledge and qualifications, taking into account current requirements for future-oriented science education and teacher education including deeper learning and critical thinking skills, cross-curricular work, education for sustainable development, and research-based teacher education.

article,Sung2022,"Using robotics and programming, this study investigated the effects of different levels of embodied instruction on the problem-solving, debugging, programming proficiency, self-determination, and self-efficacy of students in ethnically diverse elementary classrooms. The first small-scale, quasi-experimental study involved 37 second-graders, who were randomly assigned to an embody or a non-embody group. Results showed that embodied planning activities benefited these young learners' LEGO Robotics problem-solving and self-determination skills. Based on these findings, a second study implemented different types of embodied activities (full-embody, low-embody, and control condition) in a debugging problem-solving activity for 51 kindergarten and 1st-grade students, also from ethnically diverse populations. The findings from this study suggested that the embodied learning activities promoted students' problem-solving skills in robotics and the use of debugging strategies in coding applications.

article,Shumway2023,"ABSRACT: The purpose of this study was to explore how kindergarten students (aged 5–6 years) engaged with mathematics as they learned programming with robot coding toys. We video-recorded 16 teaching sessions of kindergarten students' (N = 36) mathematical and programming activities. Students worked in small groups (4–5 students) with robot coding toys on the floor in their classrooms, solving tasks that involved programming these toys to move to various locations on a grid. Drawing on a semiotic mediation perspective, we analyzed video data to identify the mathematics concepts and skills students demonstrated and the overlapping mathematics-programming knowledge exhibited by the students during these programming tasks. We found that kindergarten children used spatial, measurement, and number knowledge, and the design of the tasks, affordances of the robots, and types of programming knowledge influenced how the students engaged with mathematics.

article,Kite2021,"The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) emphasize engaging students in science practices through which students can develop content, procedural, and epistemic knowledge of science. To accomplish this goal, science teachers must embed science content in authentic science practice. Successfully integrating content and practice will require significant epistemological and pedagogical shifts on the part of teachers. However, teachers cannot meaningfully achieve this integration if they, themselves, do not understand the epistemic underpinnings of the science practices. Given the lack of literature specifically addressing teachers' epistemic understanding of science practices, we conducted a qualitative study to fill this gap in the literature. Data were collected using an open-ended online survey, and responses from 128 science teachers were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Our results indicate that relatively few teachers exhibited more nuanced epistemic understandings of scientific practice that extend beyond the rigid, linear scientific method presented in science textbooks. Teachers broadly believed that scientific inquiry must begin with a question, seldom cite methodological differences when comparing two experiments, frequently viewed models as teaching tools for representations and explanation, and hardly discussed computational thinking in terms beyond data analysis. More importantly, teachers viewed that scientific conclusions are heavily influenced by researchers' perceptions and biases. To enhance science teachers' sophisticated epistemic understanding of science, we highlight the need not only to engage teachers in authentic scientific inquiry experiences, but also to provide opportunities to learn how to effectively integrate science practices as a coherent system, especially computational thinking and models, into science lessons.",,,,"Kite, Vance and Park, Soonhye and McCance, Katherine and Seung, Elsun",10.1080/1046560X.2020.1808757,,,15731847,Journal of Science Teacher Education,"Epistemic understanding,epistemology of science,professional development,science practices,scientific inquiry,scientific method",3,243--264,,Routledge,{Secondary Science Teachers' Understandings of the Epistemic Nature of Science Practices},https://doi.org/10.1080/1046560X.2020.1808757,32,2021

Our synthesis of the literature has resulted in four key insights that are new to the field. First, RCKs have a unique double application: They may be used for direct instruction in robotics (first-order uses) or as analogical tools for learning in other domains (second-order uses). Second, RCKs make possible additional routes to learning through the provision of immediate feedback and the dual modes of representation unique to RCKs. Third, RCKs support a computational thinking learning progression beginning with a lower anchor of sequencing and finishing with a high anchor of systems thinking. And fourth, RCKs support evolving problem-solving abilities along a continuum, ranging from trial and error to heuristic methods associated with robotics study. Furthermore, our synthesis provides insight into the second-order (analogical) uses of RCKs as computational manipulatives in the disciplines of physics and biology.

I highlight how Bowers' development of the ideas, each on their own and collectively as a coherent whole, not only challenged assumed cultural ways of being for educators, but importantly, provided an alternative theoretical framework to make new sense of how education (re)produces culture. I examine these concepts in relation to Bowers' critique of STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics), the theoretical dilemmas they raise, and the ecological questions that emerge. Finally, I inquire into how the four featured ideas, STEM, and STEM education play out in the context of a community commons.

To lay the ground for such an empirical work, this paper raises the necessary questions to be taken into consideration, while reflecting on the potential implications for journalism practice. To do so, we relied on key concepts developed in Bourdieu's Field theory to assess whether automated journalism is likely to change or reinforce the prevailing journalistic doxa, or the “rules of the game” within the journalistic field.

Scientific creativity scale, robotics attitude scale and motivation scale toward science learning were used as quantitative data collection tools, and semi-structured interview form was used as a qualitative data collection tool. As a result of the study, it was found that the levels of students' creativity, attitude and motivation increased with the robotics coding activities integrated into 5E learning model applied in science subjects. In addition, it was determined that students produced many creative ideas in using robotics coding applications to solve various problems encountered in daily life, and that they were very eager for such applications being used in science classes. In this respect, it is suggested that arduino-assisted robotics coding applications should be implemented in the teaching of 6th grade science subjects.",,,,"Guven, Gokhan and {Kozcu Cakir}, Nevin and Sulun, Yusuf and Cetin, Gurcan and Guven, Emine",10.1080/15391523.2020.1812136,,,19450818,Journal of Research on Technology in Education,"Science teaching,attitude,motivation,robotics coding,scientific creativity",1,108--126,,Routledge,{Arduino-assisted robotics coding applications integrated into the 5E learning model in science teaching},https://doi.org/10.1080/15391523.2020.1812136,54,2022

By analyzing the data from one group of three pupils working together with Processing (Processing is a Java based tool primarily to learn programme visual effects supported and distributed by The Processing Foundation, https://processing.org/), the aim is to contribute to research and conceptualization surrounding how programming can be integrated in mathematics. The analysis provides examples of pupils' different arguments when they use Processing to solve a mathematical problem. An important finding is that the pupils revealed a clear progression in the argumentation categories, where they went from arguing very fundamentally to presenting more elaborated arguments.

article,Cinar2024,"The traditional legal education does not equip students with the necessary skills to address the challenges presented by technological advancement and artificial intelligence. Moreover, current attempts to address these challenges fall short of achieving their desired objectives. I argue that the only viable solution to this issue is for law schools to transition from being monolingual to bilingual. At present, law schools are monolingual in the sense that they solely teach ‘the language of the law.' This language is inherently ambiguous and vague, has a multivalent relationship with truth, and requires a particular way of thinking–‘thinking like a lawyer.' To effectively address the challenges presented by technology and survive in the age of artificial intelligence, it is imperative for law schools to become bilingual and incorporate the teaching of ‘the language of the computer.' In contrast to the language of the law, the language of the computer is clear and precise, has a bivalent relationship with truth, and requires a different way of thinking–‘thinking like a computer.' To ensure their survival, law schools must swiftly integrate the language of the computer into their curriculum to pioneer the algorithmic evolution of law within the legal field.",,,,"Cinar, Ali Ekber",10.1080/17579961.2024.2392938,,,1757997X,"Law, Innovation and Technology","Legal education,artificial intelligence,bilingualism,technology,the language of the computer,the language of the law",0,1--41,,Routledge,{The language of the law vs. the language of the computer: a bilingual model of legal education in the age of technology and artificial intelligence},https://doi.org/10.1080/17579961.2024.2392938,0,2024

article,Ammoneit2024,"Modeling is a key scientific practice and is usually computer-implemented, but it is challenging to teach because it seems high on presuppositions, for example, coding. This design-based research study presents a geography course offered during the 2019/20 winter semester in computer modeling, with no prior coding knowledge. It was implemented in two elective classes: one in the Bachelor of Science program and one in the teacher program. Interviews were conducted to monitor the students' development, and the final reports showed their competencies at the end of the course. Since there were no noticeable differences between the Bachelor of Science students and the teacher trainees in terms of competence acquisition, four learning types could be described based on analysis of the interviews and final reports, which are important for the planning and adaptation of the course concepts. In summary, our results show four key findings: (1) mere reproduction of learning content is of no value for the development of geographic modeling skills; (2) the ability to access conceptual thinking patterns is crucial; (3) process-level understanding is a fundamental prerequisite for advanced geographic modeling understanding; and (4) poor programming skills hinder but do not prevent at least basic modeling understanding.",,,,"Ammoneit, Rieke and Reudenbach, Christoph and Peter, Carina",10.1080/03098265.2023.2250991,,,14661845,Journal of Geography in Higher Education,"NetLogo,Scientific thinking,computational thinking,digital modeling,modeling competencies,teacher education",3,345--367,,Routledge,{Developing geographic computer modeling competencies in higher education},https://doi.org/10.1080/03098265.2023.2250991,48,2024

article,Guo2024a,"The assessment of information literacy (IL) is challenging. Traditional methods often fail to capture students' true performance and their behavioral processes. Evidence-centered game design (ECgD) offers an alternative assessment framework. However, IL assessment based on ECgD often overlooks further analysis of behavioral processes, which could reveal detailed performance differences beyond scores. In this study, a general ECgD paradigm is presented and this paradigm was used to develop assessment rules. Game log data were collected from 132 middle school students, who also completed an external IL test. Game logs recorded the behavioral processes, from which evidence required for assessment was extracted. Six supervised machine learning models were employed to predict students' IL levels. The assessment results indicate that students have lower levels of information knowledge and skills, as well as information thinking and behavior. Further analysis of in-game behaviors revealed that students with higher IL levels were able to complete tasks correctly and spent more time in the game, earning more coins, while seeking help less frequently. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using ECgD for IL assessment and uncover deeper differences in student performance underlying IL levels.

An important aspect of the study was to ascertain children's conceptual models of how computers operate, with the concern that an inadequate or flawed conceptual model would hamper children's ability to generalize or deepen their computer skills. In order to understand what children today know and believe about computers, the authors interviewed 18 children (eight boys) between 5 and 8 years old from two state-funded primary schools in a Scottish city. The children were asked questions about understanding what computers are, how computers are programmed, and whether computers have agency. The interviews provide insight into children's understanding of the technology they encounter in their everyday lives.

article,Hardman2021,"This largely theoretical paper traces the continued influence that the work of Vygotsky has in studying teaching/learning in schools. The advent of the 21st century has led to a call for novel pedagogical models to enable children think in ways pertinent to our technologically based societies. Currently, the 4th Industrial revolution is playing out against the backdrop of climate change, a rise in right wing movements, and a call for decolonial education to challenge the hegemony of a colonial worldview. This paper presents an argument for how Vygotsky and the Neo-Vygotskian's work does not require a novel pedagogy, but rather, that we reclaim its relevance for the 21st century, illustrating how the concepts underpinning it can be used to decolonize contemporary pedagogy. The paper foregrounds aspects of Vygotsky's work and draws on Hedegaard's further developments to argue for a decolonial pedagogy that arises from this knowledge base. The problematic addressed in this paper relates to schooling in the 4th Industrial Revolution and suggests that schooling today must be about more than the acquisition of academic content; it must be geared toward developing critical, collaborative forms of thought capable of transforming both the child and the world.

article,Mubarok2023,"In language learning, it is important to foster students' computational thinking and improve their skills of building arguments and dialectical structure, teamwork, and decision accuracy. This is especially so in English language courses which aim to promote students' cultural learning interest, creative thinking, and oral presentation. Collaborative argument mapping is an appropriate strategy to elicit those objectives. However, in the emergency distance learning (EDL) context, when online instruction lacks real-world learning and face-to-face interaction, it is challenging to teach units on cultural issues in authentic contexts. Therefore, in this study, the virtual reality-based collaborative argument mapping approach was developed to address this problem. A quasi-experiment was designed with a total of 45 EFL (English as a Foreign Language) students. The experimental result showed that the virtual reality-based collaborative argument mapping approach (VR-CAM) improved the students' English oral presentation more than did the non-virtual reality-based collaborative argument mapping approach (non-VR-CAM). Although the VR-CAM group scored higher than the non-VR-CAM group on cultural learning interest, the two groups did not significantly differ.

article,Nyman2024,"In the wake of the present inclusion of programming in mathematics education, which is a feature of curricular revisions in many countries, we have analysed newly inserted programming activities in mathematics textbooks. The aim was to investigate how such activities relate to and potentially affect students' opportunities to learn mathematics. Data consist of Swedish textbooks for grades 7–9 (ages 13–15) intended for mathematics classes, where all units labelled as or including programming activities were analysed. Concerning the relation between mathematics and programming, our results show that in the intricate balance between teaching mathematics on the one hand and teaching programming on the other hand, the textbooks seem to lean towards the latter, thus not greatly contributing with mathematical learning opportunities. We see a dominance of mathematics as a context for programming, rather than programming as a tool for learning mathematics. The lack of exploration and rare occurrence of novel mathematics in the programming activities implies a weak relationship between mathematics and programming.",,,,"Nyman, Rimma and Br{\aa}ting, Kajsa and Kilhamn, Cecilia",10.1080/0020739X.2024.2329345,,,14645211,International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology,"Programming,lower secondary school,mathematics education,textbook analysis",0,1--19,,Taylor & Francis,{Can programming support mathematics learning?

article,Mngadi2023,"Clean water and sanitation provisions are essential for good hygiene and health, with rural South Africa facing a simultaneous access crisis of both, the direct health effect of restricted access to both on mental health remaining scarce and largely overlooked. This study investigated the association between access to clean water and sanitation on depression in rural South Africa utilizing the most recent data (year 2017) from the South African National Income Dynamics Study. Our study outcome was depression, based on the 10-item abridged version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (data available in SA-NIDS), the main exposures being access to clean water and adequate sanitation facilities (i.e. flushing toilets). Two types of analyses were conducted: first, adjusted logistic regression models were fitted to assess the relationship between lack of access to clean water and adequate sanitation to depression. Second, we conducted mediation analysis to investigate whether access to clean water mediated the relationship between lack of access to toilets and depression. A high proportion of rural participants lacked access to clean water (n = 6,188, 47.6%) and adequate toilets (n = 9,797, 81.6%). The regression analyses indicated that lack of access to both clean water (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.06–1.39) and adequate sanitation (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.10–1.69) were significantly associated with greater odds of depression. The mediation analysis indicated that access to clean water partially mediated the relationship between lack of access to adequate sanitation and depression, the total mediated effect being 18.2% (95% CI: 11.0%–51.0%).

article,Schneider2024,"The goal of this paper is to bring new insights to the study of social learning processes by designing measures of collaboration using high-frequency sensor data. More specifically, we are interested in understanding the interplay between moments of collaboration and cooperation, which is an understudied area of research. We collected a multimodal dataset during a collaborative learning activity typical of makerspaces: learning how to program a robot. Pairs of participants were introduced to computational thinking concepts using a block-based environment. Mobile eye-trackers, physiological wristbands, and motion sensors captured their behavior and social interactions. In this paper, we analyze the eye-tracking data to capture participants' tendency to synchronize their visual attention. This paper provides three contributions: (1) we use an emerging methodology (mobile dual eye-tracking) to capture joint visual attention in a co-located setting and replicate findings that show how levels of joint visual attention are positively correlated with collaboration quality; (2) we qualitatively analyzed the co-occurrence of verbal activity and joint visual attention in low and high performing groups to better understand moments of collaboration and cooperation; (3) inspired by the qualitative observations and theories of collaborative learning, we designed a new quantitative measure that captures cycles of collaborative and cooperative work. Compared to simple measures of joint visual attention, we found it to increase correlation coefficients with learning and collaboration scores. We discuss those results and describe how advances in analyzing sensor data can contribute to theories of collaboration.

We found such a strategy to be the only dominant trajectory alternative to following the sequence prescribed by the syllabus. Whereas all students who took and passed the final problem set at the beginning of the course subsequently completed the course, those who took and failed the final problem set at the beginning of the course finished the fewest number of milestones, even fewer than those who never attempted the final problem set. Moreover, students with a lower prior programming proficiency were more likely than better prepared students both to take the final problem set early and to fail it.

Subsequently, much of the research literature related to the teachers' understanding has focused on probabilistic models. This study explores the extent to which secondary statistics teachers appear to understand ideas of statistical modeling, specifically the processes of model building and evaluation, when introduced using classification trees, a type of algorithmic model. Results of this study suggest that while teachers were able to read and build classification tree models, they experienced more difficulty when evaluating models.

I argue that emergent computational representations and the prompts for prediction and reflection were especially useful in supporting students' reasoning about fundamental combinatorial ideas. I argue that this particular mathematical example informs broader notions of disciplinary reflexivity and representational heterogeneity, providing insight into computational thinking practices in the domain of mathematics.

Current programming environments are mostly designed for operating on computers directly to learn concrete programming, but this approach lacks the support for clarifying learners' thinking processes. On the other hand, using paper and pens shows usability in developing creative thinking, but it cannot help verify learners' thinking results due to its nature. To benefit from both paper and computers, we developed an interactive programming learning environment consisting of a paper board game, a computer system, and a digitalization mechanism. Learners can use the learning environment to draw down their thinking results and verify them by comparing them with the evaluation on the computer system immediately. Two experiments were conducted to compare this learning environment with paper board games and computer programming environments, respectively. The experimental results show that the subjects who learn in our environment can learn to program better than those who learn with the other two.

article,Bungum2024,"Background: Integrated STEM approaches are acknowledged as important for making school subjects relevant and engaging for students and are reinforced with the current emphasis on computational thinking. Still, such approaches are rarely realized in schools. This study investigates how the traditional ‘grammar of schooling' may prevent realization of more holistic teaching in line with ideas from integrated STEM. Purpose: A concrete teaching project where students design, program and build their own weather station is presented, and we investigate the values and challenges teachers see in the project and the obstacles that may prevent them from running it in class. This way it throws light on why STEM approaches may be difficult to realize in schools. Sample: The sample consists of teachers involved in a collaborative project in which Project Weather Station was developed, including the teacher who was undertaking the project in his grade 9 class. Design and methods: The study follows a case study design, with group interviews with teachers. Observation in class, video recording and interviews with students form a backdrop of the main interview data. Results: Results show that teachers see value in the weather station project in line with the overarching aims of the curriculum and consistent with STEM ideas. Challenges they see are related to own competence, time use, risk of failure and logistics across subjects. Conclusion: It is concluded that teachers' challenges reflect a tension between overarching aims in education and the more specific competence aims in the curriculum. On a systemic level there is therefore a need for an acceptance for the value of teaching that targets overarching aims of education. It is important to acknowledge teachers' challenges and fulfil their needs for support when undertaking extensive projects that have potential for realising the more holistic aims of education typical for STEM projects.",,,,"Bungum, Berit and Mogstad, Erik",10.1080/02635143.2022.2103108,,,14701138,Research in Science and Technological Education,"Integrated STEM,grammar of schooling,interdisciplinary teaching,teachers",2,450--466,,Routledge,{Building and programming a weather station: Teachers' views on values and challenges in a comprehensive STEM project},https://doi.org/10.1080/02635143.2022.2103108,42,2024
article,Chen2024,"Background and Purpose: As a growing number of instructional units have been developed to promote young children's scientific and engineering practices (SEPs), understanding how to evaluate and assess children's SEPs is imperative. However, paper-and-pencil assessments would not be suitable for young children because of their limited reading and writing skills. To explore the assessments for SEPs available for young children aged 3–8 years, this study reviewed assessments of young children's SEPs reported in empirical studies, and analysed the characteristics of these assessments to delineate how young children's SEPs have been measured. Methods: We followed the procedures of a systematic review proposed by Zawacki-Richter et al. (2020). The EBSCOhost database was used to gather empirical studies in education and psychology. A total of 46 articles published from 2003 to 2020 met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Findings: The findings indicated that of the eight SEPs suggested by the National Research Council (2012), Analysing and interpreting data was assessed the most, followed by Using mathematics and computational thinking, Constructing explanations and designing solutions, and Planning and carrying out investigations. A majority of assessments were designed for children of 4, 5, and 6 years old and used paper-based visualizations and real objects to present the tasks and items. Additionally, due to the verbal or performance nature of the SEPs, the assessments collected different types of data as evidence to evaluate children's SEPs. Performance-based assessments were the most common, followed by multiple-choice, ranking, and oral responses. Conclusion: The findings of the reviewed assessments revealed a variety of performance expectations of SEPs and suggested that some SEPs are measurable and developmentally appropriate for young children. Also, the availability of assessments is uneven in different types of SEPs, and more assessments for information communication and modelling practices are needed.",,,,"Chen, Yi Chun and Wu, Hsin Kai and Hsin, Ching Ting",10.1080/02635143.2022.2121693,,,14701138,Research in Science and Technological Education,"Assessment,early childhood science,engineering practice,scientific practice,systematic review,young children",3,658--677,,Routledge,{A systematic review of assessments for young children's scientific and engineering practices},https://doi.org/10.1080/02635143.2022.2121693,42,2024
article,Tsortanidou2023,"This article examines how a multidimensional, skill-driven curricular framework plays out in diverse primary school settings toward a holistic K-6 curriculum framework. Particularly, it explored how unplugged tasks involve imaginative pedagogies, computational thinking skills, new media literacy skills, and social-emotional skills across three different primary schools by fulfilling two learning conditions, without coding/programming and without using digital devices. Within-case and cross-case analyses were conducted by following the qualitative multiple-case study research design. The evidence stems from lesson analysis, observation field notes, and interview transcripts with 152 participants. We collected 94 lessons from the three schools and we analyzed the data by using a predefined coding scheme grounded upon four frameworks. We conclude that the detected teaching practices uncover promising trajectories by demonstrating a great potential to consider the proposed framework as an effective and age-appropriate pedagogical approach applicable to low-technology and coding-free learning environments. The study highlights the need of teacher professional development, especially on computational thinking in reference to cognitive/intellectual, emotional/affective, social, creative/imaginative, and material dimensions for conscious computational thinking practice implementation. Given the paucity of research on unplugged and, especially, non-programming/coding methods at primary education level, this study can open up prominent issues for further examination and validation.",,,,"Tsortanidou, Xanthippi and Daradoumis, Thanasis and Barber{\'{a}}, Elena",10.1080/02568543.2022.2065390,,,21502641,Journal of Research in Childhood Education,"Case study,holistic approach,imagination,primary education,twenty-first-century skills,unplugged and coding-free",1,77--99,,Routledge,{Toward a Holistic Pedagogical Approach in K-6 Education: Evidence From a Multiple-Case Study in Spain},https://doi.org/10.1080/02568543.2022.2065390,37,2023

article,Miller2014,"When learning to program, students often mistakenly refer to an element that is structurally related to the element that they intend to reference. For example, they may indicate the attribute of an object when their intention is to reference the whole object. This paper examines these reference-point errors through the context of metonymy. Metonymy is a rhetorical device where the speaker states a referent that is structurally related to the intended referent. For example, the following sentence states an office bureau but actually refers to a person working at the bureau: The tourist asked the travel bureau for directions to the museum. Drawing upon previous studies, I discuss how student reference errors may be consistent with the use of metonymy. In particular, I hypothesize that students are more likely to reference an identifying element even when a structurally related element is intended. I then present two experiments, which produce results consistent with this analysis. In both experiments, students are more likely to produce reference-point errors that involve identifying attributes than descriptive attributes. Given these results, I explore the possibility that students are relying on habits of communication rather than the mechanistic principles needed for successful programming. Finally I discuss teaching interventions using live examples and how metonymy may be presented to non-computing students as pedagogy for computational thinking.",,,,"Miller, Craig S.",10.1080/08993408.2014.952500,,,17445175,Computer Science Education,"metonymy,misconceptions,novice programming,reference errors",2-3,123--152,,Routledge,{Metonymy and reference-point errors in novice programming},https://doi.org/10.1080/08993408.2014.952500,24,2014
article,Love2023,"Providing greater access to computer science (CS) education for K-12 students in the United States (U.S.) has increased interest in integrating CS concepts within authentic science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) contexts. Physical computing is one method that has demonstrated promising results in other countries (e.g. England) and has been receiving growing attention in the U.S., yet there remains limited research on physical computing within the U.S. Therefore, this study utilized a modified version of the Computing Attitude Questionnaire (Yadav, A., Mayfield, C., Zhou, N., Hambrusch, S., & Korb, J.

To address this gap, the study introduces and analyses the construct of digital intelligence, representing the new way of thinking and behaviour in the digital environment. For the purposes of the study, a set of tests was given to students at Greek high schools, targeting 15–16 years old students and employing original tests to assess digital intelligence. According to the findings, digital intelligence is composed of: (1) logical reasoning, algorithms, and evaluation, (2) abstraction, decomposition, and patterns and generalisation, (3) digital emotional intelligence and communication, (4) digital safety and security, and (5) digital identity, use, literacy, and rights.

Empirical investigations, accomplished over two iterations of a design-based research effort with students (aged 11–14 years) in a public school, sought to examine student understanding of algorithmic constructs, and how well students transferred this learning from Scratch to text-based languages. Changes in student perceptions of computing as a discipline were measured. Results and mixed-method analyses revealed that students in both studies (1) achieved substantial learning gains in algorithmic thinking skills, (2) were able to transfer their learning from Scratch to a text-based programming context, and (3) achieved significant growth toward a more mature understanding of computing as a discipline.

As part of that analysis, the main objectives of those activities are described and examined together with their approaches to programming and music learning contents. Findings reveal the apparent lack of a specific theoretical framework aimed at music learning goals, and beliefs about a certain affinity between music and programming, only partially defined.

article,Harlow2014,"Recent studies in learning programming have largely focused on high school and college students; less is known about how young children learn to program. From video data of 20 students using a graphical programming interface, we identified ideas that were shared and evolved through an elementary school classroom. In mapping these ideas and their resulting changes in programs and outputs, we were able to identify the contextual features which contributed to how ideas moved through the classroom as students learned. We suggest this process of idea mapping in visual programming environments as a viable method for understanding collaborative, constructivist learning as well as a context under which experiences can be developed to improve student learning.",,,,"Harlow, Danielle Boyd and Leak, Anne Emerson",10.1080/08993408.2014.963360,,,17445175,Computer Science Education,"collaborative learning,computational thinking,constructionism,elementary students,memes,programming",2-3,229--247,,Routledge,{Mapping students' ideas to understand learning in a collaborative programming environment},https://doi.org/10.1080/08993408.2014.963360,24,2014

This paper reports on a study determining what value learners and educators saw in using web design and Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). The paper comprises studies undertaken by 17 honours students in 2013 and 2014 as part of a research report module, and followed a survey research design in which 18 educators were interviewed and 319 learner questionnaires analysed. It was found that there was some disagreement regarding the level of support offered to educators having to learn HTML and that most learners enjoyed learning web design and were coping with the demands of learning HTML. Educators felt that web design ought to remain part of the CAT curriculum, although time constraints were frequently raised as problematic. The majority of learners, similarly, felt that there was value in including web design within the CAT curriculum. Workshops to support educators and a focus on computational thinking as a way forward are recommended.

Two coding schemes were used to identify both debugging processes and types of regulation used. Second, using a similar approach, eighth-grade students (N = 30) programmed a Tobbie2 robot using Microsoft MakeCode.

The CAPCT is a web-based and resource-efficient adaptive assessment of 4489 questions measuring: the understanding of basic sequences, loops, conditions (if & if-else statements), debugging, multiple agents, procedures, and the ability to generalize to a new syntax. Method: Data was collected through an existing online adaptive practice and monitoring system called Math Garden. We collected 14 million responses from 93,341 Dutch children (ages 4 - 13). Findings: The CAPCT demonstrated good psychometric qualities because 75% of the variance in question difficulty was explained by differences in item characteristics. The CAPCT demonstrated robustness against adding new participants and adding new items. Differences in player ability (i.e., understanding of CS concepts) were due to differences in age, gender, the number of items played, and prior mathematical ability.

article,Giannakouros2018,"Data analysis for formal methods is constrained due to the lengthy dominance of the econometric view within economics. Best practice in statistics suggests a shift in emphasis from making statements about the sampling distribution of numerical data summaries to seeking data summaries that communicate well. The process philosophy perspective informing the original institutionalists and also evident in the tradition of Keynes is amenable to drawing from current developments in the field of statistics toward this goal. Compared to the econometric approach, it emphasizes data analysis over statistical inference, problem- solving over theory testing, and algorithmic over analytic mathematics. In the choice of tools made possible by current technology, it favors general purpose tools that are adaptable. It favors the instrumental efficacy of computational thinking, visualization, exploration, and discovery over the ceremonial aspects of the mathematical rhetoric of economics. It also encourages the attention to ethics and assumptions stressed by statisticians.

Method: We used an iterative, design-based research approach to develop the Coding Stages Assessment (CSA), a one-on-one assessment capturing children's technical skills and expressivity. We tested 118 five-to-eight-year-olds and used Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory to evaluate the assessment's psychometric properties. Findings: The CSA has good to very good reliability. CSA scores were correlated with computational thinking ability, demonstrating construct validity. The items have good discrimination levels, and a variety of difficulty levels to capture different proficiency levels. Younger children tended to have lower scores, but even first graders can achieve the highest coding stage. There was no evidence of gender or age bias.

This article examines the current state of programming–activities addressing a local version of computational thinking–in music, with a focus on Japan's pending challenges. First, an analysis of 23 activity reports sheds light on the main features of implementation efforts conducted by elementary school teachers from all over the country. Notably, compliance with official guidelines seems to have been prioritized over subject-specific contents, and, in some cases, the mere use of digital technologies in the classroom appears to be more relevant than programming and music-making goals. Following that, two key stakeholders–Japanese professionals engaged in planning and implementing programming in music in elementary schools–provide insights on its present state and future prospects through an open questionnaire. Their often-contrasting answers include perspectives on learning goals, teachers' skills and assessment, as well as their expectations and concerns. A number of unresolved issues and tensions persist regarding how subject contents and programming should be balanced.

article,Rachmatullah2023,"The inclusion of computational thinking (CT) into science curricula has advocated implementing a computationally rich science learning environment where students learn science via building models in a computer programming platform.

Framed using Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory, this study investigated the changes and sources of changes of Indonesian teachers' self-efficacy for teaching science and CT and looking at whether the two constructs are correlated. A total of eleven Indonesian middle school science teachers (seven in-service and four pre-service) participated in a CT-integrated science instruction workshop. They then implemented the curriculum they learned and obtained from the workshop in their classrooms. The teachers took questionnaires on science and CT teaching efficacy beliefs four times: before and after the workshop and before and after they taught. As a follow-up, interviews and writing reflections were collected after they took the instruments. Skillings-Mack and repeated-measures correlation tests were run on the quantitative data, and the qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Results from quantitative analyses revealed a pattern of increasing teachers' self-efficacy for teaching science and CT in a computationally rich environment over the administrations of the instrument.

article,Cetin2016,"Recent increased interest in computational thinking poses an important question to researchers: What are the best ways to teach fundamental computing concepts to students? Visualization is suggested as one way of supporting student learning. This mixed-method study aimed to (i) examine the effect of instruction in which students constructed visualizations on students' programming achievement and students' attitudes toward computer programming, and (ii) explore how this kind of instruction supports students' learning according to their self-reported experiences in the course. The study was conducted with 58 pre-service teachers who were enrolled in their second programming class. They expect to teach information technology and computing-related courses at the primary and secondary levels. An embedded experimental model was utilized as a research design. Students in the experimental group were given instruction that required students to construct visualizations related to sorting, whereas students in the control group viewed pre-made visualizations. After the instructional intervention, eight students from each group were selected for semi-structured interviews. The results showed that the intervention based on visualization construction resulted in significantly better acquisition of sorting concepts. However, there was no significant difference between the groups with respect to students' attitudes toward computer programming. Qualitative data analysis indicated that students in the experimental group constructed necessary abstractions through their engagement in visualization construction activities. The authors of this study argue that the students' active engagement in the visualization construction activities explains only one side of students' success. The other side can be explained through the instructional approach, constructionism in this case, used to design instruction.

Marrying the physical functionalities and computer coding possibilities, ePCRs show great promise in cultivating PK-12 students' CT and 21-st century skills. However, in practice, there is a lack of experienced teachers and readily-available ePCR curricula, which poses challenges in classroom integration. Thus, the purpose of this article is to analyze publicly-available ePCR math lesson plans designed for middle school students, especially focusing on lesson characteristics, instructional strategies, assessment plans, and 21st-century skills cultivated. After analyzing 283 publicly-available ePCR math lesson plans, we found that they used a variety of educational technologies. In particular, the majority utilize physical coding and the tools' functionalities to move, draw, show visuals, and play audio. However, most of the lesson plans are in critical need of research-based instructional strategies and assessment plans and instruments.

This goal is complemented by identifying the challenges children face to advance into more sophisticated approaches to problem-solving using algorithmic thinking. Method: Fourteen five- and six-year-old students participated in this study. These children participated in unplugged learning activities, and solved two sets challenges with the BeeBot. We used a grounded theory approach to analyze how they solved these algorithmic thinking activities and the challenges they faced in this process. Findings: Our results suggest four increasingly sophisticated approaches to solving these activities: step-by-step, simple decomposition, advanced decomposition, and full algorithm design.

article,Wellner2023,"The paper proposes a framework for thinking about digital technologies, including AI, in education. The framework combines Don Ihde's postphenomenology and Seymour Papert's constructionism. The former is rooted in the philosophy of technology, the latter–in education and technology. The intersections between the two theories have been mentioned but not explored.

Objective: This study is aimed to examine the effectiveness of a novel CS curriculum (Coding as Another Language–ScratchJr) on the development of programming and computational thinking skills for students in kindergarten to second grade classrooms. Method: We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 1057 students and used multilevel regression analysis to examine the impact of the CAL curriculum on students' coding and computational thinking skills, as well as moderation analysis to investigate how students' demographic characteristics including gender, socioeconomic status, English learners and disability interacted with the intervention effectiveness. Findings: The CAL curriculum was effective in improving students' programming skills, but no significant differences were detected for students' computational thinking skills. Students with limited English proficiency and students from low socioeconomic backgrounds achieved similar gain in coding skills but students with disabilities and female students did not demonstrate the same improvements as their peers.

article,Sun2024,"Cultivating computational thinking (CT) for K-12 students has become the central issue in the digital age. However, the most significant impediment to the long-lasting development of students' CT is teachers' lack of CT and positive programming attitudes (PA). Therefore, this research aimed to explore the effects of Micro: bit programming training activities on STEM teachers' CT and PA. We conducted a quasi-experimental study with 55 elementary STEM teachers that included 12 Micro: bit programming training activities and measured changes in teacher CT and PA levels using the TCTS and TPAS. The results revealed that Micro: bit programming training activities effectively enhanced STEM teachers' CT and PA. Further analysis showed that Micro: bit programming training activities mainly improved problem-solving and creativity in CT and cognition and beliefs in PA of STEM teachers. Meanwhile, we found that Micro: bit programming training activities benefited CT and PA enhancement for STEM teachers with high educational level and low teaching years. Furthermore, the findings indicated a partially mediated effect of STEM teachers' PA in terms of educational level affecting CT, and teachers' teaching years also significantly moderated the second half of this mediated effect.

article,Yang2024a,"Background and context: There were few studies indicating if students' computational thinking (CT) self-efficacy and their CT performance were aligned with each other. Objectives: The study was to investigate if there was a discrepancy between students' CT self-efficacy and their CT performance. Method: Involving 104 non-CS undergraduate students as participants, this study employed descriptive statistics, one-sample tests, and prediction modules to perceive if a discrepancy existed. Findings: The findings revealed that students' CT self-efficacy and their performance on understanding CT showed an opposite pattern and failed to meet instructors' expectations. Moreover, students' CT self-efficacy did not significantly predict their CT performance on application or understanding. Implications: The detected discrepancy suggests that students' CT understanding needs to be improved. A variety of approaches should be employed to evaluate their CT self-efficacy.

article,Pei2018,"There is a great deal of overlap between the set of practices collected under the term “computational thinking” and the mathematical habits of mind that are the focus of much mathematics instruction. Despite this overlap, the links between these two desirable educational outcomes are rarely made explicit, either in classrooms or in the literature. This paper presents Lattice Land, a computational learning environment and accompanying curriculum designed to support the development of mathematical habits of mind and promote computational thinking practices in high-school mathematics classrooms. Lattice Land is a mathematical microworld where learners explore geometrical concepts by manipulating polygons drawn with discrete points on a plane. Using data from an implementation in a low-income, urban public high school, we show how the design of Lattice Land provides an opportunity for learners to use computational thinking practices and develop mathematical habits of mind, including tinkering, experimentation, pattern recognition, and formalizing hypothesis in conventional mathematical notation. We present Lattice Land as a restructuration of geometry, showing how this new and novel representational approach facilitates learners in developing computational thinking and mathematical habits of mind.

article,Li2023a,"Computational Thinking (CT) is regarded as a crucial competency for all children in the 21st century. There are misconceptions about CT which confounds CT skills with programming skills. However, CT skills and programming skills are not the same. CT is a broader skillset of cognitive thinking that is integral to complex problem solving. Teaching and assessing CT should not only focus on computer programming. In this project, a new design-based learning (DBL) approach was proposed to improve elementary school students' CT. This approach not only included programming skills, but also integrated CT practices with authentic real-life contexts. Corresponding to recent conceptions of CT, we also assessed CT in a more comprehensive manner. A quasi-experiment study was carried out to assess how the intervention was associated with students' self-perceived CT skills using both quantitative and qualitative methods. In the treatment group, twenty-three fourth graders engaged in three curriculum units to create artifacts that solve specific real-world problems using LabPlus electronic kits and Scratch programming software. The control group took a traditional computer science class. Results revealed that students' self-perceived CT skills increased to a greater extent in the treatment group compared to the control group. In addition, we observed and interviewed three student cases in the treatment group to understand the potential learning effects of our new DBL approach.

article,Kong2024,"Logistic regression models have traditionally been used to identify the factors contributing to students' conceptual understanding. With the advancement of the machine learning-based research approach, there are reports that some machine learning algorithms outperform logistic regression models in terms of prediction. In this study, we collected cognitive, affective, and demographic data from 4,142 primary students as features to predict their understanding of computational thinking (CT) concepts. We identified and used five popularly used machine learning models. All five machine learning models outperformed the logistic regression model, with the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model achieving the highest predictive accuracy. We used these features and the K-means algorithm of the unsupervised clustering technique to identify four optimal clusters of students. By comparing the representative students from each of the four clusters, selected by the t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding algorithm, we found that each cluster had its characteristics. For example, one cluster consisted of students who outperformed students in the other three clusters in mathematics, scored highest in prior experience in programming, and used computers and the Internet most frequently. By identifying the characteristics of these clusters, pedagogical design, and resource support can be proposed to support students' learning of CT concepts.",,,,"Kong, Siu Cheung and Shen, Wei",10.1080/10494820.2024.2331148,,,17445191,Interactive Learning Environments,"Clustering,XGBoost model,computational thinking concepts,machine learning-based approach,t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding",0,1--14,,Routledge,"{Using students' cognitive, affective, and demographic characteristics to predict their understanding of computational thinking concepts: a machine learning-based approach}",https://doi.org/10.1080/10494820.2024.2331148,0,2024

The findings reveal the predominantly exploratory nature of research in this area and underscore the prevalence of positive outcomes associated with CT integration. Moreover, the study identifies prominent pedagogical strategies such as problem-based learning and the engineering design process, highlighting their integral roles in CT integration. Additionally, the findings uncover the interconnectedness of modeling and simulation, computational problem-solving, and systems thinking practices within CT-integrated science interventions.

article,Santo2024,"Background: While advocates for integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into existing K12 classrooms have acknowledged and aimed to address various barriers to implementation, we contend that a more foundational issue–tensions between the epistemology of computing and those of existing disciplines–has largely been overlooked. Studies of contact between heterogeneous disciplinary perspectives in both pedagogical and real world professional settings point to other risks, and harms, that educators may need to consider as they attempt to integrate CT into their teaching. As such, designing for integrated CT pedagogies does not simply require addressing functional problems such as teacher professional learning and limited classroom time, but rather implicates complex epistemological navigations. Objective: This manuscript explores epistemic tensions between Computational Thinking (CT) and K12 humanities and arts disciplines and possibilities for their resolution. Method: Based on a Delphi study with 43 experts from three disciplines–language arts, social studies, and arts–as they engaged in 20 hours of focus group conversations exploring potential approaches to integrating CT these disciplines, analysis focused on identifying perceived epistemic tensions that can arise in the context of instruction and directions for their resolution. Findings: We found 5 epistemic tensions that are explored in detail: contextual reductionism, procedural reductionism, epistemic chauvinism, threats to epistemic identities, and epistemic convergence, as well as a number of potential directions for navigating them.

We used this framework to qualitatively analyze our preservice teacher participants' edTPA (teacher performance assessment) lessons—including their written commentaries, video-recorded lesson excerpts, and student work samples—for their implementation of the NGSS using mathematics and computational thinking practice. We examined (1) the integration of the mathematical content and practices outlined in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics within the target NGSS practice, and (2) the cognitive demand of the mathematics in relation to science and mathematical practices. We found that four of our six preservice teachers implemented lessons that were integrated and cognitively demanding: These participants used the mathematics to move students' understanding of the science phenomena forward.

Nevertheless, a critical gap remains in developing practical fashion prototyping strategies that fuse with computational thinking to challenge current norms and envision the future of fashion. This study introduces shape change-based fashion prototyping as a design strategy for dynamic expressions and affordances to inspire fashion practitioners' interdisciplinary endeavors. We present three studio-based practices as case studies to demonstrate how shape-changing mechanisms including servo motors, shape memory alloys, and pneumatics, spur new fashion construction skills and broaden the scope of potential applications. By doing so, this study contributes to material and conceptual innovation, creating pathways for the seamless integration of technologies from conceptualization, and implementation to envision. Our findings shed light on design possibilities and challenges and offer design recommendations that guide future endeavors.

article,Nouri2020,"Teachers around the world have started teaching programming at the K-9 level, some due to the formal introduction of programming in the national curriculum, others without such pressure and on their own initiative. In this study, we attempted to understand which skills–both CT-related and general–are developed among pupils in the process of working with programming in schools. To do so, we interviewed 19 Swedish teachers who had been teaching programming for a couple of years on their own initiative. The teachers were selected based on their experience in teaching programming. Our thematic analysis of these interviews shed light on what skills teachers perceive pupils develop when programming. This led us to identify three themes related to CT skills and five themes related to general skills. The CT skills identified corresponded well with and were thus thematically structured according to the dimensions of CT proposed in the framework of Brennan and Resnick, namely computational concepts, computational practices and computational perspectives. In addition to the CT skills, our thematic analysis also resulted in the identification of general skills related to digital competency and 21st century skills, namely cognitive skills and attitudes, language skills, collaborative skills and attitudes and creative problem-solving skills and attitudes.",,,,"Nouri, Jalal and Zhang, Lechen and Mannila, Linda and Nor{\'{e}}n, Eva",10.1080/20004508.2019.1627844,,,20004508,Education Inquiry,"21st century skills,Computational thinking,digital competency,k-9,programming",1,1--17,,Routledge,"{Development of computational thinking, digital competence and 21st century skills when learning programming in K-9}",https://doi.org/10.1080/20004508.2019.1627844,11,2020

article,Ozdinc2022,"ISSN: (Print) (Online) Journal homepage: https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/vsca20 ABSTRACT STEM and computer science (CS) education are some of the most important research topics of the last decade. The idea that CS should be a part of STEM is becoming more and more common. The most important goals of integrating CS into STEM are to develop students' computational thinking (CT) and problem-solving skills. STEM education creates a natural context for integrating CT into learning and teaching processes. However, applied studies are needed since the subject is new and open to development. In this study, we designed an interdisciplinary unplugged programming activity to integrate CT into STEM activities which we then implemented in a professional development course (PD) with the participation of STEM teachers. To evaluate the effectiveness, an open-ended questionnaire was given to the teachers and the results were analyzed. Accordingly, the teachers stated that the activity was exemplary in applying the interdisciplinary approach and enabling the perspectives of different disciplines to be seen by other subject-area teachers. Also, using unplugged programming activities in teacher education provides an important example. Teachers who want to conduct unplugged programming activities in their classrooms, learn how to integrate CT into STEM, are interested in the practice to support their students' research skills, and aim to support students' 21st-century skills can also use this activity. The interdisciplinary structure of the activity and its example of integrating CT into STEM will guide practitioners and researchers in the field.",,,,"{\""{O}}zdin{\c{c}}, Fatih and Kaya, G{\""{o}}khan and Mumcu, Filiz and Yıldız, Bahadır",10.1080/00368121.2022.2071817,,,0036-8121,Science Activities,,3,151--159,,Routledge,{Integration of computational thinking into STEM activities: an example of an interdisciplinary unplugged programming activity},https://doi.org/10.1080/00368121.2022.2071817,59,2022

In addition, this study examined the effect of the training on the spatial visualization abilities and computational thinking skills of the students. Method: The study employed a one-group pre-test/post-test quasi-experimental design. A total of 60 university students (51 female and 9 male) participated in this study. University students received three-dimensional design and coding training by using Tinkercad. The Spatial Visualization Test, the Cognitive Flexibility Scale, the Computational Thinking Scale and semi-structured interview form were used to collect data. Paired samples t-test and one-way ANCOVA were used for the data analysis. Results and discussion: Results from the training indicated that the students' spatial visualization abilities improved. Their spatial visualization abilities and computational thinking skills were related to their cognitive flexibility levels. The training also improved the spatial visualization abilities and computational thinking skills of students with high cognitive flexibility. 3D design and coding education could be more effective for students with high cognitive flexibility.

article,Leung2024,"This study investigated the development of computational thinking (CT) in young children within the specific context of Hong Kong. The researchers utilized an unplugged digital arts activity to explore the CT knowledge exhibited by children and document their developmental trajectories. A sample of 23 children aged 3 to 6 years participated in an animation art workshop conducted in a Hong Kong kindergarten. The video data were recorded and analyzed in terms of content. Drawing on a three-dimensional framework combining powerful ideas for teaching coding, the observations and field notes revealed that children's CT knowledge construction aligned with the CT conceptual framework. Notably, older children demonstrated more advanced competences and more complex cognitive structures in terms of the design process, representation, algorithms, modularity, sequences, connecting, choices of conduct, and utilization of hardware/software. These findings emphasize the importance of designing age-appropriate curricula that foster children's CT skills through the animation art.",,,,"Leung, Suzannie K.Y. and Wu, Joseph and Li, Jenny Wanyi",10.1080/03004430.2023.2299405,,,14768275,Early Child Development and Care,"Computational thinking,early childhood education,self-directed learning,unplugged activities",2,208--229,,Routledge,{Children's knowledge construction of computational thinking in a play-based classroom},https://doi.org/10.1080/03004430.2023.2299405,194,2024
article,Gero2019,"The invention of the computer has led to the establishment of a new research paradigm, computation, which has recently become more and more popular in scientific exploration. However, computation is not well represented in high school and university curricula in science and engineering, although it applies to a wide range of disciplines beyond computer science and software engineering. In light of the increasing need to provide students with computational education, this paper presents a novel way to develop computational thinking among students. The proposed approach is based on the implementation of Papert's theory of constructionism in electronic spreadsheets. In this approach, students build their knowledge while constructing the difference equation that describes a physical (or engineering) phenomenon, based on specific cases investigated in the spreadsheet. The method does not require the students to write code or perform complex calculations in the spreadsheet and makes it possible to teach advanced subjects at a relatively early stage. The method is demonstrated through contents taken from the secondary and tertiary curricula in mechanics and electromagnetism.",,,,"Gero, Aharon and Levin, Ilya",10.1080/0020739X.2018.1501827,,,14645211,International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology,"Computational thinking,Constructionism,Difference equations,Spreadsheets",5,779--787,,Taylor & Francis,{Computational thinking and constructionism: Creating difference equations in spreadsheets},https://doi.org/10.1080/0020739X.2018.1501827,50,2019
article,Jocius2023a,"This paper documents the Making CT researcher-practitioner partnership, designed to support in-service elementary teachers in understanding and integrating computational thinking into their disciplinary teaching. Drawing from this collaborative work with teachers, over a sustained time, we describe the shifts in teachers' integration of CT into their teaching, as well as shifts in their abilities to attend to children's development of CT skills. In doing so, we have developed a unique construct–pedagogical content knowledge learning trajectories–which draws from literature on learning trajectories, the use of learning trajectories for teacher professional development, and domains of knowledge for teaching. Operationalizing our construct, we propose two specific learning trajectories–first, for integrating CT into disciplinary teaching, and second, for attending to students' computational thinking–which we describe and illustrate using data from the Making CT teachers. This includes a description of professional learning experiences that supported teacher growth on each of the two learning trajectories, thus explicating the knowledge gained and classroom impact from participation in the Making CT project.

This framework, which can be applied to any subject at the elementary school level, is grounded on specific principles that we have gleaned from both learning theories and considerations on child development. New media literacy skills (NML) and social-emotional skills are also targeted, as they are strongly connected with CT skills and display bidirectional linkages that can comprehensively benefit students in various ways (cognitively, imaginatively/creatively, materially, socially, and affectively/emotionally) without the need for digital technologies or coding. The universal nature of our curricular proposal rests on the following factors: it is based on a cross-disciplinary approach that can be applied in ways that mirror real life; CT is seen as a universal skill that should be learned by everyone, not just computer scientists, and is applicable to every aspect of daily life; one-sided intellectualism is avoided; and, lastly, the resulting classroom practices have an impact on and are influenced by children's cognitive, social, and emotional development.",,,,"Tsortanidou, Xanthippi and Daradoumis, Thanasis and Barber{\'{a}}, Elena",10.1080/10494820.2021.1986725,,,17445191,Interactive Learning Environments,"Computational thinking,K-6,curricular framework,unplugged",8,4903--4923,,Routledge,{A K-6 computational thinking curricular framework: pedagogical implications for teaching practice},https://doi.org/10.1080/10494820.2021.1986725,31,2023

Almost all research related to computational thinking mentions problem solving. Although some research has been conducted on computational thinking, few studies examined the impact of personal traits on students' computation thinking skills and problem solving. This study modeled cooperative attitudes of programming, learning style, self-regulation, and enjoyment as its key elements, investigated personal traits as predictors of problem-solving skills, and examined the correlation between variables and computational thinking. The 252 research participants were all sixth-grade students in an elementary school in Taipei, Taiwan. After a 10-week experimental curriculum, a posttest was conducted, and a total of 244 observations were collected. Correlation and regression analyses show that computational thinking is positively correlated with problem-solving skills, and learning style has the predictive ability for computational thinking. Furthermore, cooperative attitude and self-regulation of programming are important variables for predicting problem-solving skills; the degree of students' enjoyment in the curriculum will affect the cooperative attitude and self-regulation of their programming.

This study explored teachers' perceptions and concerns about integrating CT in science teaching. Twenty-two science teachers from innercity secondary schools in South Africa were chosen to be part of this exploratory case study. Data were collected through take-home assignments and focus group discussions containing a series of open-ended questions. The concern-based adoption model was used as a lens to understand teachers' stages of concern. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. It was found that sampled science teachers viewed CT as a valuable tool that can help promote learners' data management practices and problem-solving practices, especially in reducing complex problems to researchable problems. The findings also showed that teachers intend to integrate CT into their science classrooms by refining their existing practices. However, teachers showed high informational, personal and management-related concerns regarding integrating CT in South African science classrooms: they needed more practical and contextual ideas on strategically integrating CT in their daily lessons. Conversely, teachers showed limited concern at the unrelated, consequence, collaboration and refocusing stage.

article,Jou2023,"Previous research suggests that there should be a correlation between computational thinking and traditional cognitive and motor skills. At present, academia either considers cognitive skills a part of computational thinking, or investigates the correlation between computational thinking and cognitive skills. Current research on computational thinking focuses on the design of teaching models to improve computational thinking ability and on measures for evaluating computational thinking. The association of computational thinking with motor skills is rarely discussed. From the perspective of embodied cognition theory, an association must exist, but its mechanisms have not been studied. Therefore, this study explores the effect of the teaching model of creative problem solving (CPS) on computational thinking and its internal correlation with technical skills. It was found that CPS can not only improve the computational thinking ability of students majoring in engineering, but also promote their corresponding motor skills. However, the students' previous academic background had a certain influence on their learning outcomes. Students at universities of technology experienced a greater improvement in their computational thinking and motor skills than students at general universities.

The study group consisted of eighth-grade students from a public middle school in Turkey, selected according to the convenient sampling method. A computational thinking test was used to collect quantitative data, and observations and semistructured interviews were utilized for the collection of qualitative data. According to the results of analyses, when the effects of the pretest scores were not considered, there was a significant difference (F.469, 1, R2 =.518) between the final test scores of the experimental and control groups in favor of the former. Based on these findings, it can be stated that the proposed STEAM-based program significantly improves the computational thinking skills of eighth-grade middle school students.",,,,"Bati, Kaan and Yetişir, Mehmet Ikbal and {\c{C}}alişkan, Ilke and G{\""{u}}neş, G{\""{o}}khan and Sa{\c{c}}an, Esma G{\""{u}}l",10.1080/2331186X.2018.1507306,"Chapman, Debra Laier",,2331186X,Cogent Education,"Computational thinking,STEAM,Science education,Time",1,1507306,,Cogent OA,{Teaching the concept of time: A steam-based program on computational thinking in science education},https://doi.org/10.1080/2331186X.2018.1507306,5,2018

article,Lee2023a,"While research has shown that students' epistemic beliefs can be a strong predictor of their academic performance, cognitive abilities, or self-efficacy, studies of this topic in computer education are rare. The purpose of this study was twofold. First, it aimed to validate a newly developed questionnaire for measuring students' epistemic beliefs about computer programming at middle school level. Second, the study aimed to understand how students' epistemic beliefs predict their computational thinking disposition and computer programming self-efficacy. A total of 406 middle school students completed a survey consisting of three research instruments: the Computer Programming Epistemic Belief Inventory (CPEBI), the Computational Thinking Scale (CTS), and the Computer Programming Self-Efficacy Scale (CPSES). The results indicated that the epistemic belief of “uncertainty” was a significant and positive predictor of the “abstraction” and “generalization” dimensions of computational thinking dispositions. In addition, the belief of “complexity” was an antecedent to three dimensions of computational thinking, namely, “algorithmic thinking,” “evaluation,” and “generalization.” Only the “evaluation” dimension of CT disposition had significant and positive relationships with “programming self-efficacy.” The roles of “uncertainty” and “complexity” of computer programming epistemic beliefs are discussed.

article,Kite2023,"Recognizing that the power of computation has changed the practice of science, science education standards in a number of countries have included a call for the inclusion of computational thinking (CT) in K-12 science education. As CT is a relatively new construct, preparing inservice science teachers to implement CT-infused learning experiences depends on the creation of robust CT professional development (CT-PD) initiatives. Given that teachers' understandings, attitudes and beliefs impact their teaching, an important step in the development of these programs is identification of teachers' conceptualizations of CT and its role in science education as well as their perceived barriers to CT/science integration. Additionally, scholars have noted that teacher PD is more effective when it is tailored to the needs of participating teachers. To this end, this survey study examined secondary science teachers' conceptualizations of CT, perceived barriers to CT/science integration, and the types of professional support they believe is needed to overcome these perceived barriers. Analysis of 123 open-ended surveys revealed that secondary science teachers: (1) conceptualize CT as a specific type of thinking that can be used to build science students' problem-solving skills; (2) view their lack of CT understanding as a primary barrier to CT/science integration; (3) believe their students are academically unprepared for CT-infused science; and (4) want CT-PD focusing on the what, why, and how of CT/science integration.

Objective: With this study, I aim to answer the question: Within makerspace activities what evidence exists regarding promising practices that support youth development of CT skills and dispositions? Method: This case study takes place in a summer makerspace program, in which I examine the interactions of four facilitators with seventeen high school-aged participants through video, audio, screen recordings, participant notebooks, and observer field notes. Findings: Findings inform our understanding of practices instructors can utilize in making activities to assist students in advancing their CT skills/dispositions: tinkering, embodiment, walkthroughs, drawing, and debugging. Implications: In a making environment where tinkering is promoted, instructors need to provide explicit guidance in the application of CT while tinkering.

The purpose of this phenomenographic study was to understand teachers' perceptions of the function and usefulness of a task analysis and a decision tree tool designed to help them with integration. Teachers participated in a long-term professional development to improve their knowledge and application of CT and then developed lesson plans integrating CT into science investigations. To assist in the integration, teachers used the two unique tools. No one lesson plan or content area addressed all of the CT practices, but all CT practices were addressed in lessons across all four science areas. All 19 teachers found that the task analysis tool helped them to shift their lessons to a student-centered focus and helped them pinpoint data practices so they could systematically integrate CT practices. However, they expressed confusion over the amount of detail to document on the tool. Similarly, teachers found both benefits and barriers to the decision tree tool. Teachers found the decision tree tool to be useful in predicting the ways students may misunderstand a data practice and in reflecting on the level of accomplishment of students.

article,Wilkerson2020,"There is considerable debate and ambiguity around what constitutes “computational thinking” (CT). In contrast to Computer Science which is generally treated as a distinct field of study, CT as a construct highlights the integral relationship between computing and other fields. Many recent efforts seek to map computational thinking by making high-level connections to other school disciplines. We argue that while these efforts may help identify specific curricular areas in which computing is likely to take place, they do not sufficiently capture the specificity and dynamism that is characteristic of meaningful computational integration. Worse, they exclude generative examples of computing integration that exist outside of the traditional STEM context or researcher-led efforts. In this special issue, we offer a counterproposal to one-size-fits-all frameworks of CT by exploring in detail how local, emergent definitions of CT develop across a diversity of spaces of learning. Reflecting on these examples can help researchers and educators alike cultivate an awareness of the ways in which learners and educators leverage computing to think, create, and participate across a variety of spaces.",,,,"Wilkerson, Michelle Hoda and D'Angelo, Cynthia M. and Litts, Breanne K.",10.1080/10494820.2020.1711326,,,17445191,Interactive Learning Environments,"Computational thinking,computational integration,computational literacy,interdisciplinary computing,situated computing",3,264--271,,Routledge,{Stories from the field: locating and cultivating computational thinking in spaces of learning},https://doi.org/10.1080/10494820.2020.1711326,28,2020

article,Cian2024,"While both citizen science engagements and computational thinking practices can mutually support student ownership in the science classroom, both face similar challenges to adoption in that they require teachers to openly position themselves as learners alongside their students. This dual role—as a teacher and as a learner—poses self-efficacy challenges that may preclude teachers from exploring these important pedagogical tools and perspectives in their classrooms. We present a cross-case analysis of three experienced teachers in rural elementary and middle schools as they integrate computational thinking in a year-long, student-led community-based citizen science project. Drawing from interview data, we illustrate how teachers' capacity to embrace their role of co-learners alongside their students redefined “mastery experiences” of teaching self-efficacy. Specifically, the case teachers evaluated their successful use of computational thinking within the community-based citizen science program in ways that valued student curiosity and discovery over mastery of content. In this way, their self-efficacy for using computational thinking developed when they saw and shared these activities in themselves and their students. We further illustrate how contextual contributors of the professional development program and their rural schools and districts contributed to their comfort in experimenting with new instructional approaches, which helped them to build the mastery experiences that fueled further exploration of computational thinking within their classroom's community-based citizen science investigations.",,,,"Cian, Heidi and Brasili, Alexandria",10.1080/1046560X.2024.2375843,,,15731847,Journal of Science Teacher Education,"Community-based citizen science,computational thinking,professional development,rural,self-efficacy",0,1--23,,Routledge,{Rural Elementary Teachers' Computational Thinking Self-Efficacy Through Community-Based Citizen Science},https://doi.org/10.1080/1046560X.2024.2375843,0,2024

Method: We conducted interviews with teachers from Norway and Finland, where CT is included in the national core curricula. The interviews were analysed thematically by adapting a framework for CT integration into subjects. Findings: Teachers found CT assessment to be challenging, due to its broader scope beyond coding.

The experiment consisted of two different phases, a programming phase linked to the instruction in Scratch and focused on the acquisition of basic concepts of computational thinking (sequences, iterations, conditionals, and events-handling), and a mathematical phase completely oriented towards the resolution of mathematical tasks. In particular, the mathematical phase focused on word problems whose resolution involves the use of the least common multiple and the greatest common divisor.

This study investigates the types of tabletop games that are currently being promoted as teaching computational thinking, who such games are marketed towards, and how game designs could provide opportunities for developing computational thinking. We conducted a content analysis to explore the type of tabletop games currently being created, their audiences, and the kinds of game mechanics and design features being implemented to teach computational thinking concepts. In this study, we created a taxonomy of computational thinking tabletop games that identified three primary categories (e.g. code building, code execution, and puzzle games).

In this study, we pursued an embedded research design, merging teacher action research with qualitative case study, into collaborative inquiry. Through analysis of classroom-based data, including samples of student work, we were able to develop an understanding of the manner with which student understanding of computational thinking emerged in this classroom. Findings suggest that, through the integration of carefully designed learner-centered tasks, students came to view computational thinking as computer mediated data analysis or an approach to analyzing data and solving problems. The iterative nature of the instructional design—three consecutive units built around the same heuristic of data-patterns-rules—as well as the variety of learning-centered tasks given to students, appeared to have enabled the teacher and students to have a common set of procedures for problem solving and a common language to articulate the goals and outcomes of data analysis and interpretation.

Objective: Assessing learning in libraries is difficult given their informal nature. This is especially true when trying to assess a new and ill-defined construct like CT. A first step towards better supporting informal educators is to identify the motivations for bringing CT into informal spaces and to understand the current state of assessing CT in public libraries. Method: Thirty-seven interviews with library staff from across the United States were conducted and analyzed. Findings: This work reveals the variety of motivations justifying the inclusion of CT programming for youth in libraries, the challenges associated with assessing CT in libraries, and identifies the assessments library staff would like to be able to conduct for their own CT-related programming.

However, in-service teachers are largely unprepared for this implementation, which, in turn, makes teacher educators (TEds) important stakeholders in preparing prospective teachers to integrate CT into their classroom practices. In this regard, TEds are charged with a twofold responsibility: they must develop not only their own CT skills and digital competence but also a way of teaching these to the next generation of teachers who will facilitate future pupils' learning.

article,Jun2017,"The results of this study indicated that design-based learning (DBL) improves computational thinking (CT) in a sample of elementary school students. The experiment consisted of participants using the Scratch Program and Creative Computing Guidebook, both developed by the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) media laboratory, for a total of 15 hours. An experimental group and a control group were formed and consisted of fourth to sixth graders. DBL was applied to the experimental group, while a traditional, direct method of teaching was applied to the control group. The experiment was designed to examine several aspects of learning: self-efficacy, self-interest, and self-CT. Moreover, we compared changes in students' perceptions of computers and analysed differences in students' responses between the two groups according to each of the steps of DBL. Then, we verified the effects of DBL by examining the progress of each group and the differences between the two groups.

article,Lachney2021,"Recent scholarship in computer science (CS) education shifts from a focus on the technical-cognitive skills of computational thinking to the socio-cultural goal of computational participation, often illustrated as remixing popular media (e.g. music, photos, etc.) in online communities. These activities do enhance the participatory dimensions of CS, but whether they also support broadening the participation of underrepresented youth remains unclear. While online communities that are dedicated to computational participation have existed in the U.S. for over a decade, many communities of color remain underrepresented in CS disciplines. How might CS educators, researchers, and technologists promote culturally responsive forms of computational participation? To answer this question, we propose a culturally responsive framework for computational participation called generative computing. Generative computing approaches CS as a means for strengthening relationships between learning environments and local communities, leveraging culturally relevant sources of wealth generation in technology design and implementation. To explore this concept, we conducted a mixed-methods study with a cosmetology high school program that predominantly serves young African-American women. Through a series of computationally and culturally rich cosmetology projects, we tested our hypothesis that generative computing can enhance connections between Black heritage, CS, and cosmetology while supporting students' academic interests and knowledge.",,,,"Lachney, Michael and Babbitt, William and Bennett, Audrey and Eglash, Ron",10.1080/10494820.2019.1636087,,,17445191,Interactive Learning Environments,"Computer science education,broadening participation,computational participation,computational thinking,cosmetology",7,1115--1135,,Routledge,{Generative computing: African-American cosmetology as a link between computing education and community wealth},https://doi.org/10.1080/10494820.2019.1636087,29,2021
article,Lai2021,"Due to their applications on varied and complex issues, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) (collectively, AIoT) have become popular new-generation courses, but the learning of such courses needs to consider actual situations and to analyze complicated problems, making it difficult for students to improve their academic performance. The concept of computational thinking education is to allow students to find solutions to problems in different fields by understanding the problems and analyzing solution steps. In this study, we integrate the concept of computational thinking education into a course on plot image-based virtual reality (VR). It combined shooting of the actual field, instructions on the movie required to be shot, and VR in order to enable students to get immersed in thinking about problems and understanding the actual field through plot image-based VR, further plan to learn the essence of problems, and develop possible solutions.

However, it is not clear whether a simulation game (SG) with different user interface elements, created via three-dimensional (3D) virtual worlds and visual programming environments to project various problem-solving exercises in a simulated reality, can significantly influence students to think and practice ""computationally"" their solution plans into code. The current study aims to identify any possible added value of each instructional approach by measuring students' game experience and learning performance.

article,Xing2021,"Previous research has invested much effort in understanding how programming can contribute to the development of young learners' computational thinking (CT) in traditional K-12 classroom settings. Relatively few studies have examined programming for CT in informal online communities, especially for large scale quantitative research. With the repurposing and appropriation of code becoming standard practice for youth programmers in new and networked communities, this study proposes a model to investigate and explain how such remixing practices influence CT in learners. In particular, we use social cognitive theory to transform log data from more than 100,000 students and 200,000 programs in the Scratch online community into cognitive, environmental and behavioral factors. Then path modeling was used to show how the community environment can affect learners' remixing and further impact CT skills. The results demonstrate the intertwined relationships among the factors, generally showing that remixing can lead to CT improvement, but that over exposure to the community and excessive remixing can actually hinder CT development.

article,Wong2020,"The role of programming in computing education for children has grown rapidly in recent years with the proliferation of specially designed programming tools, which is grounded on Seymour Papert's theoretical work in Constructionism. Studies show that some children can develop computational thinking skills and practices with programming activities when learning with the tools through a well-design curriculum in elementary education (or primary education). However, existing studies may not completely address whether programming skills and computational thinking can be connected to the development of other generic skills, which are considered important to the learning and cognitive development of children. This study investigates the impact of programming on three learning competencies (creative thinking, critical thinking and problem solving) known as twenty-first century skills. The conceptual mapping between programming, computational thinking and the three learning competencies is presented. In a one-year intervention in a primary school, students were taught how to build interactive games through programming, and thus explored some basic computational thinking concepts in class. Our results show that children perceived a significant impact of programming on their learning competencies. Yet, the transferability of twenty-first century skills developed through computational thinking and programming may require a further study.

article,Saez-Lopez2017,"The pedagogical integration of computing is interesting in educational contexts based on the contributions of Seymour Papert and Wing's concept of computational thinking. Integrating arts in education can lead to the design of activities using Scratch combined with devices. The main goal is to evaluate the integration of computational thinking in art education making use of technological resources, sensor cards and minicomputers, with a student-centred pedagogical approach. This research assesses the results of a control group of 35 students and an experimental group of 109 students in four different schools, using Mann-Whitney's U-test for independent samples assessing 'Active Learning', 'computational concepts' and 'fun' scales. Applying data triangulation, and consistent with design-based research, the results of interviews and focus groups reinforced the results obtained in the aforementioned test, providing validity to the study. There are advantages regarding student interest, motivation and commitment related to programming technologies in art and education, particularly pedagogical sessions with music. Handling devices, sensors and Raspberry Pi provides participating students with a factor of commitment and enthusiasm, with significant improvements.

article,Jackson2022,"Background and Context: Computational thinking and practices (CT|P) are key competencies for learners in science and engineering.

Objective: Based on research literature from 2016 to early 2019 for CT|P in required science and engineering classes with youth ages 10-15–a sensitive age range for cognitive and affective development–we wrote a literature review that argues for the use of more pluralistic and critical research philosophies, which will strengthen research design, implementation, and meta-inferences (Collins et al., 2012). Method: We analyzed 20 qualifying studies per research philosophies common to mixed research, giving extra attention to studies that acknowledge cultural pluralisms, engage those pluralisms in conversation with each other, and ensure that historically marginalized populations have equiTable–not just equal–participation (Onwuegbuzie & Frels, 2013). Findings: We found that studies consistently emphasized pragmatism-of-the-middle and communities of practice; sometimes operated within critical realist, pragmatism-of-the-right, or transformative-emancipatory philosophies; and rarely engaged in dialectical ways. Implications: To avoid decontextualized or overly individualistic approaches that fail to address systemic and institutional social inequities (in education, housing, healthcare, policing, voting, etc.), future work should take more pluralistic and critical philosophical approaches.

article,Williamson2016,"Reflecting political shifts toward both ‘network governance' and ‘digital governance', the idea of ‘learning to code' has become part of a major reform agenda in education policy in England. This article provides a ‘policy network analysis' tracing the governmental, business and civil society actors now operating in policy networks to project learning to code into the reformed programs of study for computing in the National Curriculum in England. The insertion of learning to code into the curriculum provides evidence of how the education policy process is being displaced to cross-sector ‘boundary organizations' such as ‘policy labs' that act as connecting nodes to broker networks across public and private sector borderlines. It also examines how the pedagogies of learning to code are intended to inculcate young people into the material practices and systems of thought associated with computer coding, and to contribute to new forms of ‘digital governance'. These developments are evidence of a ‘reluctant state' deconcentrating its responsibilities, and also of a computational style of political thinking that assumes policy problems can be addressed using the right code.

article,Lui2020,"Portfolios have recently gained traction within computer science education as a way to assess students' computational thinking and practices. Whereas traditional assessments such as exams tend to capture learning within artificial settings at a single point in time, portfolios provide more authentic opportunities to document a trajectory of students' learning and practices in everyday contexts. Furthermore, because communication itself has been defined as an important computational thinking practice, portfolios give students a place to practice this skill in the classroom. In this study, we report on the implementation of a digital portfolio with a class of 21 high school students used to capture the process of creating of an electronic textile mural project. While students' understanding of computational concepts were only partially captured within the portfolios, their engagements with computational practices–such as debugging and iteration–were better highlighted. Much of this was due to the students' existing communicative strategies themselves, both in terms of how precise they were in describing issues, as well as how they leveraged images and code to explain their process. Recommendations for designing more effective portfolio assessments are discussed, which include greater emphasis on creating shared classroom discourse, and leveraging students' existing experiences with multimedia.",,,,"Lui, Debora and Walker, Justice T. and Hanna, Sheri and Kafai, Yasmin B. and Fields, Deborah and Jayathirtha, Gayithri",10.1080/10494820.2019.1612446,,,17445191,Interactive Learning Environments,"Computational thinking,assessments,communication,computational practices,portfolios",3,284--301,,Routledge,{Communicating computational concepts and practices within high school students' portfolios of making electronic textiles},https://doi.org/10.1080/10494820.2019.1612446,28,2020

However, the compatibility between games and instruction is often insufficient to accommodate the entertaining and educational nature of the curriculum entirely, and the benefits of game-based learning could be compromised. Therefore, this study proposed a role-playing-based micro-game strategy for developing students' CT in a Python programming course, and designed a quasi-experiment to verify the effectiveness of the role-playing-based micro-game strategy. A total of 133 eighth-grade students from schools in eastern China were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group used a role-playing-based micro-game strategy, and the control group used a traditional instructional strategy. The results showed that the experimental group scored significantly higher than the control group on the CT test, especially in the dimensions of computational concepts and computational practices. The learning engagement of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group, and the learning motivation of the experimental group was significantly improved before and after the experiment.

article,Ciftci2023,"Background: In order for computational thinking (CT) to be successfully implemented in educational environments, teachers' CT teaching self-efficacy beliefs should be developed. The existing research on this topic is generally focused on training in-service teachers on CT to develop their self-efficacy. Conversely, the current study aims to contribute to the development of early childhood pre-service teachers' CT teaching self-efficacy beliefs through CT-integrated STEM education. Purpose: In the current study, the effect of CT-integrated STEM education on CT teaching self-efficacy beliefs of early childhood pre-service teachers was explored. Sample: The study group was composed of 68 second-year early childhood pre-service teachers. All were attending a state university in the city of İstanbul during the 2020–2021 academic year. Design and Methods: The study employed a quasi-experimental design, i.e. the control group was given only STEM education, while the experimental group was given CT-integrated STEM education. The data collection tool used in the current study was ‘the scale of self-efficacy beliefs towards teaching computational thinking'. For analysis, an independent samples t-test and a paired samples t-test were used. Results: The findings have revealed that there is a significant difference in the post-test scores on the ‘scale of self-efficacy beliefs towards CT teaching' in favor of the experimental group. The effect size calculated for the difference between the mean pre-test and post-test scores of the experimental group students was found to be large.

article,Rich2020,"A key debate in computer science education is whether and how computational thinking (CT) is used within disciplines other than computer science. Broad definitions provide many avenues for developing integrated instruction, as practices within existing activities can simply be reframed in terms of CT. But such general use of the term CT may confuse its meaning and dilute its power as a tool for bringing CS to all. In this paper, we take the viewpoint that mathematical thinking and computational thinking share common practices, such as using repetition to accomplish tasks, but these shared ideas may develop differently in mathematics and computer science. We use document analysis to analyze the K-5 Common Core State Standards for Mathematics for the presence of these common practices and describe the specific ways they develop in mathematics. We compare these elements of mathematical thinking to related elements of CT to identify synergies and differences between CT and mathematical thinking.

Objective: This study investigated the effects of a game which is based on experiential learning theory under framework of the four-component instructional design model on undergraduate students' learning performance in conceptual knowledge of object-oriented programming and computational thinking skills. Method: A pre-test and post-test quasi-experimental design was used to study the effects of the experiential serious games on conceptual knowledge of OOP and CT skills of 61 non-engineering students with and without prior programming knowledge.

article,Vallance2016,"In a world where technology has become pervasive in our lives, the notion of IT integration in education practice is losing its significance. It is now more appropriate to discuss transforming pedagogy where technology is not considered a tool anymore but part of what we are. To advance this hypothesis, an enterprising, student-directed approach is proposed which embraces problem-solving as activity and computational thinking as knowledge development. In order to test its efficacy, a case study of students developing a 3D virtual space for international collaboration is used to exemplify the transformational pedagogy. From observations of the enactment of heutagogical characteristics and computational thinking, it is argued that we can now teach and learn “in” technology.

We did so using learning analytics, specifically, by operationalizing a log-based assessment of computational creativity. We find some evidence for an association between Computational Creativity and Computational Thinking: Demonstrating originality in an early stage of the game is associated with succeeding in this stage relatively easily, however negatively associated with progressing farther in the game.

After setting the three forms against the cultural backdrop of the convergence between the open-source movement and professional journalistic norms, the study introduces a four-part typology to evaluate their epistemological and professional dimensions. In it, the three forms are classified according to their orientation toward professional expertise or networked participation, transparency or opacity, big data or targeted sampling, and a vision of an active or passive public.

article,Roberts2024,"While there is a growing body of research that explores the integration of music and coding in learning environments, much of this work has either emphasised the technical aspects of computer language design or music as a motivational context within which to learn computer science concepts. In this paper, we report on a study in which five undergraduate students with experience in both music and coding completed two creative musical tasks: one using conventional instruments and tools and one using Python code in an online music + coding environment. Inspired by the work of Christopher Small (1998. Musicking: The Meanings of Performing and Listening. University Press of New England), we describe music + coding as a set of interlocking processes which we call computational musicking and explore how practices from both domains are reimagined in this new hybrid context. We introduce semiotic theories of translation and transcription to make sense of the computational musicking process and describe strategies that participants devised in their creative process.",,,,"Roberts, Cameron L. and Horn, Michael S.",10.1080/0144929X.2024.2402533,,,13623001,Behaviour and Information Technology,"Computational literacy,STEAM education,music + coding,music education",0,1--21,,Taylor & Francis,{Computational musicking: music + coding as a hybrid practice},https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2024.2402533,0,2024

article,Toews2017,"Inquiry-based pedagogies have a strong presence in proof-based undergraduate mathematics courses, but can be difficult to implement in courses that are large, procedural, or highly computational. An introductory course in statistics would thus seem an unlikely candidate for an inquiry-based approach, as these courses typically steer well clear of proof, have a list of required topics, and depend critically on computational software. On the other hand, the American Statistical Association (ASA) has long advocated the sort of active and exploratory class design that in many respects parallels traditional inquiry-based learning (IBL). This paper reports on the author's recent attempt to implement an inquiry-based course in introductory statistics that fuses established IBL techniques with the specific pedagogical recommendations of the ASA. A signature feature of this course is that many of the inquiry-based activities are explicitly tied to computer work in the open source language R.",,,,"Toews, Carl",10.1080/10511970.2016.1211204,,,19354053,Primus,"IBL,education,inquiry,mathematics,statistics",7,707--724,,Taylor & Francis,{Computational Inquiry in Introductory Statistics},https://doi.org/10.1080/10511970.2016.1211204,27,2017
article,Lamb2019,"Critical thinking when engaged in science problem solving around even simple tasks such as the Piagetian volume conservation task is a complex endeavor. Tasks such as the conservation task often require the interaction of multiple cognitive systems. Parity judgment, retrieval, and lateral thinking are three examples of such systems interacting with critical thinking during a student's attempt to solve the Piagetian task. The purpose of this computational ablation study is to establish the role of critical thinking as a necessary component of a system of cognition used for the completion of the Piagetian volume conservation task. This ablation study consists of three phases. The confidence interval between the ablation model and the elementary students do not overlap, indicating they are not statistically significantly different. This provides evidence that the model successfully emulates aspects of human cognition and the model can provide a robust picture of science student cognitive processes.",,,,"Lamb, Richard and Firestone, Jonah and Schmitter-Edgecombe, Maureen and Hand, Brian",10.1080/00220671.2018.1514357,,,19400675,Journal of Educational Research,"Critical thinking,Piaget,cognition,computational models,elementary science",2,243--254,,Routledge,{A computational model of student cognitive processes while solving a critical thinking problem in science},https://doi.org/10.1080/00220671.2018.1514357,112,2019

Data collected for this study include in-person and video observations, reflective journals, artifacts, and interviews. Findings suggest that this teacher integrated data science literacies into her classroom by supporting multiple avenues for data storytelling and relying on learners' everyday discourse and experiences.

article,Brainin2022,"The study's purpose was to examine the contribution of a programmable robot to an intervention program for promoting spatial ability (spatial relations, visual-memory, mental rotation) of preschool children. Eighty-four participants were randomly assigned to three intervention groups: programmable-robot-based intervention, traditional intervention, control group. Spatial ability was examined pre- and post-10 intervention sessions. Findings indicate that the children exposed to the programmable-robot intervention displayed significantly higher spatial-relations and mental-rotation improvement compared with the traditional intervention and control group. However, the robot did not contribute to visual-memory.

article,Ribeiro2018,"Stress memory and an effective signaling among individuals in a given community are recognized to improve plant performance under recurrent stressful conditions. As living beings with memory and signaling abilities, plants can be considered as processing units and then be trained–or programmable from a computational viewpoint–and prepared for facing biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we propose that sentinel plants could improve the resilience of agricultural and natural communities by reducing the impact of biotic or abiotic stressors on their neighbors. Modeling plants as programmable (or trainable) processing units compels us to think about a multidisciplinary perspective for integrating stress memory, signaling, and resilience of biological systems into executable programs, fostering the creation of applications and technologies that would benefit from the spatiotemporal dynamics related to plant-plant and plant-environment interactions.",PMID: 30260272,,,"Ribeiro, Rafael V. and Torres, Ricardo da Silva",10.1080/15592324.2018.1526001,,,15592324,Plant Signaling and Behavior,"Communication,computational thinking,memory,network,plant community,programming,resilience,signaling",10,e1526001,30260272,Taylor & Francis,{Sentinel plants as programmable processing units: insights from a multidisciplinary perspective about stress memory and plant signaling and their relevance at community level},https://doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2018.1526001,13,2018
article,Espinal2023,"Background and context: Transfer is a process where students apply their learning to different contexts. This process includes using their knowledge to solve problems with similar complexity, and in new contexts. In the context of programming, transfer also includes being able to understand and use different programming languages. Objective: This study explores: (a) student ability to transfer from a block-based programming language into another block-based programming language; (b) student ability to transfer from a block-based programming language to a text-based programming language; (d) student ability to transfer their learning within the same programming language; and (d) the difficulties students had to transfer in these contexts. Method: A group of students participating in a program called Coding For Kids explained three different programs in different programming languages during an interview protocol. The students used the programming language MakeCode, and worked on transfer activities in Scratch and Python. Findings: The results suggest that while most students are able to transfer between block-based programming languages, most of them struggle to explain a program in a text-based programming language, and to solve a new coding challenge. Implications: Instructional designers should consider different strategies to facilitate student transfer into professional programming languages, which is particularly difficult for non-English speakers.",,,,"Espinal, Alejandro and Vieira, Camilo and Guerrero-Bequis, Valeria",10.1080/08993408.2022.2079867,,,17445175,Computer Science Education,"Colombia,Computational thinking,MakeCode,blocks,education,programming language,python,scratch,transfer",4,567--599,,Routledge,{Student ability and difficulties with transfer from a block-based programming language into other programming languages: a case study in Colombia},https://doi.org/10.1080/08993408.2022.2079867,33,2023
article,Kallia2023,"Background and Context: Since the surge of grounded cognition (GC) theories in cognitive psychology, many studies have focused on demonstrating the importance of embodiment and sensorimotor activities on students' conceptual development. In computing education, however, there is not yet a conceptual framework for developing age-appropriate. Objective: This paper brings these sets of work together, showing how the wider grounded cognition literature can be of value to computing education. The main objective of the paper is to suggest and set the theoretical foundations of a model for conceptual development in the early years of computing education. Method: The paper is a conceptual paper and thus, it is based on an extensive account of relevant cognitive psychology and education literature. Findings: The paper presents a model for conceptual development (EIFFEL -Enacted Instrumented Formal Framework for Early Learning in Computing). The general premise underlying the model is that programming concepts are first realised as actions performed on objects; as such, it aims to describe children's conceptual development in computing from their first actions on concrete objects to entirely abstract forms of action representation epitomised by a program. Implications: The model constitutes the first attempt to theorise conceptual development in the early years of computing education; as such it is expected to be used for the design of learning trajectories that progressively advance children's conceptualisations from concrete, situated and multi-modal to formal and more abstract representations.",,,,"Kallia, Maria and Cutts, Quintin",10.1080/08993408.2022.2140527,,,17445175,Computer Science Education,"Grounded cognition,computational thinking,computing education,conceptual development,physical computing,unplugged computing",4,485--511,,Routledge,{Conceptual development in early-years computing education: a grounded cognition and action based conceptual framework},https://doi.org/10.1080/08993408.2022.2140527,33,2023
