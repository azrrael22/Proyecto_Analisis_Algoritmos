article,OZMUTLU2021100833,"Although there are different definitions for computational thinking in the literature, it is possible to define it mainly as problem solving, designing and interpreting new systems by thinking like a computer. According to Wing (2006), computational thinking is a way of designing a system and understanding human behaviors by focusing on the basic concepts of the computer sciences. The recent focus on computational thinking as a key 21 st century skill for all students has led to a number of curriculum initiatives to embed it in K-12 classrooms and to introduce computing ideas to students early during their schooling years. The present study aims to explore the effects of a short, intensive coding and robotics training on the computational thinking skill self-efficacy of middle school students. 24 fifth graders participated in the study and data were collected by means of the Computational Thinking Self-efficacy scale (CTS) and one open-ended question. Analyses of the pre, post and delayed tests revealed significant differences between the pre and post-tests.",,Meltem Özmutlu and Derin Atay and Barış Erdoğan,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsc.2021.100833,,,,1871-1871,Thinking Skills and Creativity,"Computational thinking, Algorithm, Programming",,100833,,Collaboration and engagement based coding training to enhance children’s computational thinking self-efficacy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187121000481,40.0,2021,,
article,KOREN2023101240,"Methodological innovations across social sciences are opening new avenues for conducting research designed to address real-world challenges. The benefits of utilizing the Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach in public libraries to resolve a persistent problem of practice, a lack of assessment tools to evaluate youth Computational Thinking (CT) programs, is demonstrated. Findings from a three-year, three-phased study utilizing the DBIR approach to design and implement a suite of assessment tools to assess CT programming in public libraries are presented. Guided by the four principles of the DBIR approach, this research produced new knowledge, including identifying CT program outcomes, challenges, and recommendations for designing and implementing assessment tools to measure the impact of public libraries' CT programming.

article,CHEN2024101995,"Although there is controversy surrounding rewards and competition in education, they are key elements in digital game-based learning (DGBL). Research on the influence of rewards and competition in DGBL often yields mixed results, suggesting a need to investigate individual game elements and their interactions. This study implemented DGBL focusing on computational thinking (CT) in 7th-grade classes. Both quantitative and behavioral data were collected to understand the impact of rewards (power-up or customization) and competition (with or without) on students’ intrinsic motivation, game performance, behaviors, and CT skills. The findings uncovered significant interactions between rewards and competition. Students with both competition and power-up rewards achieved the highest game points but the lowest CT performance, whereas those exposed to the same power-up rewards without competition attained the lowest game points but the best CT performance.

article,NA2024100650,"Despite growing interest in early childhood computational thinking (CT), there is a lack of validated assessments for children who are emerging readers. This paper presents validity and reliability evidence of a performance-based assessment of CT using item response theory (IRT) from 272 children aged 4–8. Using a two-parameter logistic model IRT model (2PL IRT), we confirmed that model- and item-level fits are acceptable. Item analyses revealed a high discriminability (M = 2.26, SD = 1.12) and a moderate item difficulty (M = −0.21; SD = 0.86), on average, across 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the assessment was substantially reliable (marginal reliability: rxx = 0.87). Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses indicated that the assessment estimated children's item parameters fairly, regardless of their gender and age. However, we confirmed gaps in latent ability (θ) of CT by gender and age: boys showed higher latent ability of CT than girls, and old children (above 72 months) showed higher latent ability than young children (below 72 months). Findings suggest the assessment is a fair measure that can serve as a reliable and valid tool to assess CT for children who are emerging readers.",,Chungsoo Na and Jody Clarke-Midura and Jessica Shumway and Wilhelmina {van Dijk} and Victor R.

article,XU2022101041,"Computational thinking (CT) is an important and essential skill for human beings to master in the 21st century. Although CT has received wide attention since this concept was proposed, the current theoretical models have not well defined the complex relations between CT and other cognitive abilities for young children. To provide insight into this gap, the current study proposed a model in which we hypothesized that CT was significantly related to arithmetic fluency that is viewed as an important domain of mathematics. Additionally, arithmetic fluency was predicted to mediate the relations of CT to other cognitive abilities, including reasoning and creativity. This study tested such direct and indirect relations in children aged 5–6 years. Consistent with previous studies on older age groups, the results showed that CT and arithmetic fluency were significantly related to each other and both were significantly related to reasoning ability and creative thinking as well. Moreover, this study, for the first time, indicated that arithmetic fluency totally mediated the relation between CT and reasoning ability, suggesting that these concepts share conceptual commonalities, such as the cognitive processes related to mathematics or/and abstraction; in contrast, arithmetic fluency did not mediate the relation between CT and creative thinking, suggesting that gaining CT skill may exert direct positive effect on the development of creativity. Therefore, despite the root in computer science, CT is associated with many cognitive and learning abilities in other domains, supporting the importance of including CT into early school education.",,Weiqi Xu and Fengji Geng and Lin Wang,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsc.2022.101041,,,,1871-1871,Thinking Skills and Creativity,"Computational thinking, Arithmetic fluency, Reasoning ability, Creative thinking, Mediation effect",,101041,,Relations of computational thinking to reasoning ability and creative thinking in young children: Mediating role of arithmetic fluency,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187118712200044X,44.0,2022,,

article,KONG2023104707,"Computational thinking (CT) education in K-12 requires extensive teacher development. This research investigates the effectiveness of a scalable and sustainable teacher development programme in promoting CT in primary education. This report presents two studies. Study 1 reports on the effectiveness of two 12-h courses using Scratch and App Inventor programming environments for CT development of teachers respectively, which involved 245 teachers from 47 primary schools. With teaching practices embedded, the programme, which used the framework of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), significantly enhanced teachers' content-related knowledge dimensions. The results indicate that the programme helped teachers develop advanced CT concepts such as data structures and procedures. Study 2, using thematic analysis, reports on CT strategies implemented in 47 schools through 94 school visits. The most mentioned strategies were the formation of teaching teams, lesson co-planning, and the integration of CT with subject teaching. The most mentioned challenges were teacher readiness, lesson time, and diversity – learners' abilities, interests, and approaches. Four types of support, including teacher development support, continuous and communal support, teaching materials support, and financial support were identified. The results suggest that a course-based programme with mixed programming environments and embedded teaching experience effectively develops teachers’ capabilities. However, continuous support for teachers in implementing the initiative after completing the programme is important, especially in addressing learner diversity and integrating CT with subject teaching.",,Siu-Cheung Kong and Ming Lai and Yugen Li,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104707,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"Computational thinking, Primary schools, Scaling up, School visits, Teacher development",,104707,,"Scaling up a teacher development programme for sustainable computational thinking education: TPACK surveys, concept tests and primary school visits",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131522002780,194.0,2023,,

article,BERSON202357,"Early evidence suggests that robot programming offers an important foundation for spatial reasoning and computational thinking; however, researchers have debated how to introduce young children to these skills. We explored how preschoolers develop understanding of spatial concepts and computational thinking as the children took turns navigating a path during guided play with a programmable robot. Our analysis of the data included a multimodal visualization of the exchanges between the teacher, children, and a programmable robotic device. The findings highlight the effects that arose from the physical-digital convergence of technology integrated into play including: (a) the robot evoked a chain of actions, enacting pedagogic forces that transformed children's learning; (b) children used their own bodies as spatial referents, co-locating themselves in space with the robot; (c) the teacher remained a key actor, providing verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to promote children's understanding and mastery of spatial and computational concepts; and (d) talking with the teacher about spatial concepts combined with the interactions with the robot enhanced children's acquisition of spatial ideas relative to the quantity of children's verbal expressions and complexity of their applied spatial skills and computational thinking.",,Ilene R.

article,ANGELI2022100329,"Workers in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics play a significant role in the sustained growth and stability of the global economy, and, thus constitute a critical component in helping all countries worldwide to prosper. In this context, computational thinking constitutes an important skill to have as it enables workers to develop creative solutions to complex problems. Nonetheless, across all economies worldwide, there is a need to have more workers who are able to think through problems, challenges, and solutions in computational terms. It is thus of utmost importance to integrate the teaching of computational thinking in K-12 education in order to reduce the skills gap between education and the workplace. A pertinent and crucial question that arises is whether teachers have the knowledge and skills to teach students how to think computationally. Existing research shows that teacher education departments do not currently have the knowledge to promote computational thinking in their programs. The present study focuses on two aspects of computational thinking, such as, algorithmic thinking and debugging skills with the use of scaffolded programming scripts in an educational technology undergraduate course. The results show statistically significant learning gains in pre-service teachers’ algorithmic thinking and debugging skills in the context of robotic programming activities with LEGO WeDo.

article,KONG2024105126,"Recent studies identify Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) as a key factor in enhancing cognitive development, particularly within Computational Thinking (CT) literature. However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students’ cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes.

article,SONG2021106746,"Educational research on predicting learners’ computer programming performance has yielded practical implications that guide task designs in computer education. There have been attempts to investigate learners’ computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners’ computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners’ computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners’ coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners’ computer programming behaviors. We then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. In our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners' learning performance and computational thinking skills.

article,UNG2022104379,"Malaysia has introduced computational thinking skills as part of a curriculum integration update to meet the global trends in 21st-century education, focusing on empowering digital literacy. Nevertheless, a preliminary investigation revealed an apparent lack of understanding of computational thinking skills in general among teachers. The study explores the feasibility of developing a localized E-learning system to train computational thinking skills among teachers. An E-learning system, termed as myCTGWBL, was developed on the basis of a newly proposed conceptual framework to present computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire to the teachers. The hypothesis is that myCTGWBL would develop teachers' computational thinking and its position in teaching–learning understanding. myCTGWBL relevance was tested through DeLone and McLean's information system and Urbach's collaboration quality construct. To determine the success factors, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. A total of 369 teachers participated in a two-stage survey. Participants' understanding of computational thinking and perceptions were recorded at the pre- and post-intervention phases. Open-ended questions of the surveys were analyzed using a simple text analysis technique. The closed-ended questions surveys were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22.0. A significant improvement in teachers' computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire in a relatively short period has been recorded.

article,WU2024105012,"Efforts to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into academic courses have been gaining popularity. CT is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the MAXQDA 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. The results of this study indicate that incorporating CT into an English writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students.

To address this knowledge gap, this systematic review examined 26 studies on the teaching and learning of computational thinking in early childhood education from 2010 to 2022. The content knowledge, tools, pedagogical design, assessment methods, and learning outcomes were analyzed. Results indicated that, with age-appropriate instructional design, children could develop early concepts and skills of computational thinking, as well as other related skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem solving. Across the studies, we found that most studies used quantitative research methods, with direct assessment and observation being the most. Several challenges were identified: (1) achieving a deeper learning of computational thinking; (2) a lack of valid and reliable computational thinking assessments for children with a wider age range; (3) selecting appropriate learning tools; and (4) designing age-appropriate activities for young learners. Although with these challenges, computational thinking education could bring new learning opportunities and enhance children's computational thinking skills, as well as other non-cognitive skills such as critical thinking, body-material interaction, and hand-eye coordination.

The present study analyzes options for effective teaching assessments, which include evaluating final grades and measuring the differences between students’ pre- and post-tests (normalized gain) using standard instruments. The content area and the instrument used in this study originated in the computational thinking field, which has a widespread presence in engineering, where minorities are at a disadvantage. This study obtained a total of 88 student participants from four sections of an introductory engineering course at a Southwestern institution. The study utilized a computational thinking diagnostic (CTD) to inform the course teaching approach (the intervention). Results show that (a) normalized learning gains correlated moderately with SETs, (b) final grades correlated strongly with SETs, (c) final grades correlated strongly with normalized learning gains, (d) the educational intervention based on the CTD significantly affected student learning, and (e) SET comments affect evaluations. The implications include the notion that standardized instrument-driven instruction and evaluations can increase the success of minorities on both sides of the classroom.

article,FAGERLUND2022100511,"This article explores a new but expanding research topic: primary school students’ computational thinking (CT) in the context of programming in pairs. The data comprises four fourth-grade student dyads using Scratch, a block-based programming tool, for two open-ended creative programming sessions. We sought insight into how the dyads put four intertwined CT dimensions – planning; iteration; collaboration, social interactions, and remixing; and debugging – into practice. To examine these dimensions, the data was analysed systematically in three overlapping layers: what happens on the computer screen (design events), who uses the computer (computer control), and what kind of talk is occurring (talk). The temporal viewpoint in the multi-layered analysis revealed and enriched holistic understanding of key computational and social factors, such as initial project planning methods, programming tendencies, and pair programming roles that essentially shaped the dyads’ design processes. Next to opportunities for more focal research in CT education, the results provide especially evidence-based pedagogical knowledge for supporting students’ open-ended programming in the classroom.

Drawing on embodied notions of cognition, we first examine the literature that supports how children's computational thinking emerges as a possibility space that involves conceptualizing possible actions in a given moment, deciding which action to take by anticipating the results of a possible action, and learning from the actions that they have taken. We then use a grounded approach to analyze the problem-solving process of two 5th-grade children who engaged in an educational robotics activity over two 50-minute class periods. The findings lend support for approaching children's computational thinking as a cycle of action-taking that includes conceptualizing, anticipating, and taking action.

The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students’ mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students’ CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem-posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students’ mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students’ interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity.

article,BARKELA2024100463,"Theory
The successful implementation of computational thinking into primary schools requires that primary school teachers feel safe and confident in teaching this topic to young learners. However, many student teachers face low expectancy of success and heightened anxiety towards computational thinking. Self-worth theory suggests that this may lead to a self-worth threat and in consequence to engagement in self-protective behaviours, hampering the successful acquisition of skills needed to implement computational thinking into their future classrooms.
Aims
This study aims to investigate potential self-worth threats as amplifiers of student teachers’ resistance to engage in computational thinking.
Method
323 student teachers participated in the study. Participants filled out a questionnaire on expectancy of success and anxiety towards computational thinking, and rated how likely they were to engage in self-protective behaviours, i.e., self-handicapping, avoiding novelty, and academic cheating, when learning about computational thinking at the start of the semester.
Results
Students showed heightened levels of anxiety and low levels of expectancy towards computational thinking. Further, they reported that they would be likely to engage in self-protective behaviours. A structural equation model showed that anxiety towards computational thinking was positively related to self-protective behaviours. Moreover, expectancy had a negative indirect effect via anxiety towards computational thinking on self-protective behaviours.
Discussion
Student teachers might experience self-worth threats when learning about computational thinking and engage in self-protective behaviours that might hamper their success.

To understand the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation, the current study conducted a meta-analysis to analyze studies from Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases (2012–2022) which screened using keywords ``computational thinking'' and ``robot''. After further screening, 26 peer-reviewed articles were selected. We synthesized the 33 effect sizes to assess the overall effectiveness of robot-supported learning on CT and its sub-dimensions: concepts, practices, and perspectives. Our findings revealed a medium effect of robot-supported learning on students' CT (g = 0.643), a large effect on CT concepts (g = 0.650), a medium effect on CT practices (g = 0.587), and a huge effect on CT perspectives (g = 1.419). We also explored the moderators (i.e., grade level, study duration, culture, learning strategy, and assessment tool) that might influence the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation. Moderator analyses indicated that short-term (less than four weeks) robot-supported learning had a larger effect (g = 0.901) on CT practice than long-term (more than eleven weeks) learning (g = 0.309).

Although initiatives have been taken to define the term for educational practices, limited empirical evidence is available to clarify its underlying components, especially at the primary education level. This study aimed to identify the associations between CT and specific cognitive skills in the primary school context. Based on the literature, three cognitive domains were studied (i.e., mathematical, visuospatial, and reasoning skills) and standard test batteries were applied to a sample of 633 primary students (aged 7–12 years). Linear regression analyses were performed with CT performance as the dependent variable to investigate its associations with the measured cognitive skills, and demographic features (i.e., age, gender) and coding learning experience (i.e., years of coding experience, extra-curricular coding experience) were included as control variables. The results indicated that the students’ CT performance was significantly predicted by their attainments in numeracy, visual perception, spatial visualisation, and inductive reasoning, and the results remained significant after controlling for demographics and coding experience. The study adds to the literature by enriching the understanding of CT as a psychological construct and has practical implications for educational stakeholders regarding the importance of interdisciplinary teaching and the integration of specific cognitive skills into CT learning activities.",,Shuhan ZHANG and Gary K.W.

article,SILVIS2022100491,"Computational thinking (CT) is receiving growing attention in educational contexts, where robot coding toys are becoming a widely available means of teaching and learning early computing. As the field of child–computer interaction continues to define what it means for young children to think computationally, much is unknown about the affective dimensions of children’s interactions with computers, for example how children care for materials like coding robots and how they establish social responsibility in computational environments. This paper examines these questions in the context of an early childhood coding curriculum designed to support CT in Kindergarten. Children’s talk and interactions with robots provide insight into how they were learning to care for and maintain robots when they malfunctioned. Drawing together feminist perspectives on computing, constructionism, and care, we develop a notion of a technological ethic of care and locate this in children’s early coding experiences. Through critical discourse analysis, we present two cases where groups of children interacted with each other, their teachers, and a robot called Cubetto, establishing forms of responsibility for technology. We argue that an ethic of care must be part of computational discourses in an era of climate change, where caring for technologies and keeping them in working order is key to sustainable socio-ecological relations.",,Deborah Silvis and Jody Clarke-Midura and Jessica F.

However, at present, analysis remains scant on the correlation between students' programming attitudes and their CT skills, and less attention is paid to the influencing effects of gender and programming experience. This study first validated a newly developed programming attitudes scale (χ2/df = 2.308, RMSEA = 0.073, CFI = 0.925, TLI = 0.912) among 1180 seventh-grade students (12–13 years old). It then analyzed the relationship between students' programming attitudes and CT skills considering gender differences. Students' programming attitudes significantly predicted their CT skills. Girls have higher CT skills than boys, but their more negative programming attitudes may affect their continued skill development. Third, the relationship among programming experience, programming attitudes, and CT skills was discussed among the sample (N = 175) with programming experience, revealing that programming attitudes played an intermediary role between programming experience and CT skills. Two specific factors of programming experience (first time learning programming and programming learning duration) had differing effects on students' programming attitudes and CT skills. For programming attitudes, the grade in which students got started with programming had no effect on their programming attitudes, but programming attitudes rose with increased programming learning time. For CT, students who learned programming starting in second grade possessed the highest CT level. In addition, there is an inverted U-shaped curve between students' programming learning duration and CT skills, peaked at the fourth year of programming learning career.

Two types of mind mapping, construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study.

article,FALLOON2024105045,"In recent years, the development of computational thinking (CT) has become integral to many school curricula worldwide. This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a ‘21St Century’ competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area.

The board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. A mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. The tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. Tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children.

Teachers who are largely new to coding are expected to guide entire student bodies through the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. But little is known about which coding and computational thinking (CT) concepts teachers feel most comfortable with and which concepts they struggle with. This study describes 127 elementary coding teachers’ changes in their beliefs about teaching coding and CT as they participated in year-long continuous professional development. Novice elementary coding teachers demonstrated most growth in their self-efficacy for teaching sequences, algorithms and loops. They were less secure in their knowledge of conditionals, variables, and functions. For computational thinking, teachers were most confident in their ability to identify patterns, think algorithmically, understand logic, and evaluate outcomes, showing less growth with decomposition and abstraction.",,Peter J.

article,ZURNACI2024101576,"This study compares the effects of coding education with educational robot and unplugged coding activities on pre-school students' computational thinking and executive function skills. This study used a pre-test and post-test comparison group quasi-experimental design. The study was conducted in a public kindergarten with 48 pre-school students (24 educational robot- BeeBot® group and 24-unplugged coding group) aged 5-6. The TechCheck-K test was used to measure computational thinking skills, and Executive Functions Battery-Computerized Touch was used to measure executive function skills. The process started with pre-test applications and ended with post-tests after four weeks (16 different sessions) of the implementation in both groups. The study found a statistically significant difference between the computational thinking pre-test and post-test scores of pre-school students in both groups in favor of the post-test. It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the educational robot group between the post-test scores of computational thinking skills. In addition, when the findings regarding executive functions were evaluated, there was a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of total executive function in favor of the post-test in both groups. However, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of both groups in terms of total executive function skills scores. In addition, when the post-test scores of pre-school students in two groups were evaluated, it was determined that there was no significant difference in computational thinking and executive function skills according to gender. Consequently, it was determined that coding education with an educational robot was more effective for gaining computational thinking skills than unplugged coding activities for pre-school students.

article,NOCERINO2023112626,"Since environmental and energy issues and challenges continues to emerge as key global concerns, Green Building Certification Systems are becoming increasingly relevant in the construction industry. In this regard, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. However, due to the high level of complexity of the LEED system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of “design friendliness” and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. CAD, BIM). This makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation and/or construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. The application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. This kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific LEED credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a “designer friendly” working environment. In particular, Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with VPL tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of LEED credits. To demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales – neighbourhood and building – are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology.",,Giovanni Nocerino and Mattia Federico Leone,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2022.112626,,,,0378-7788,Energy and Buildings,"LEED, Environmental Design, Computational Thinking, Visual Programming Language, Algorithm Aided Design",,112626,,Computational LEED: computational thinking strategies and Visual Programming Languages to support environmental design and LEED credits achievement,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778822007976,278.0,2023,,

We thus proposed a CT curriculum framework for ECE that covers CT concepts (i.e., control flow/structures, representation, and hardware/software), CT practices (i.e., algorithmic design, pattern recognition, abstraction, debugging, decomposition, iteration, and generalizing), and CT perspectives (i.e., expressing and creating, connecting, perseverance, and choices of conduct).

For this reason, this systematic mapping synthesizes 82 studies on CT teaching, through the implementation and evaluation of tools and activities to teach, improve or measure the CT knowledge acquired by children. Furthermore, studies on courses or training offered to preschool teachers related to the teaching of CT were also considered. From the selected studies, the following information was collected: year of publication; recovery sources and databases; vehicles and places of publication; temporal delimitation of research, research approach, nature and research method; CT teaching approaches; tools used to teach CT and how they are classified according to their physical characteristics and, finally, participants and individuals responsible for the research. The results suggest an increase in the number of publications in recent years, revealing the interest of researchers in the topic. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards the use of physical artifacts and the use of the disconnected computing approach to teaching CT skills to preschool children. The results also exposed that preschool teachers have little autonomy in implementing CT teaching activities because those are mostly implemented by computer professionals (researchers, teachers, etc.). This is because preschool teachers are still discouraged from teaching computer and technology-related content to children, considering them complex and disconnected from basic curricula. However, when teachers are trained to teach CT, they become interested in the content and become more active during the teaching process.

In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. Since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated CT test, which was initially designed for middle school students. In our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. The analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted CT assessment for primary school students. Moreover, findings indicated CT's positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. Our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of CT with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. In summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with CT at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with CT both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with CT from primary education level to the university level and beyond. These differences imply that several basic cognitive abilities support CT abilities and CT development differentially across ages.",,Katerina Tsarava and Korbinian Moeller and Marcos Román-González and Jessika Golle and Luzia Leifheit and Martin V.

article,MARTINNUNEZ2023100128,"The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born as the possibility of simulating the human brain's learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students’ intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students’ computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking.

It is necessary to design a design thinking learning framework that addresses independent learning and specific processes that will improve students' 21st-century skills. The existing literature has not implemented flipped programming courses from a design thinking perspective (Cook & Bush, 2018), which would thus be an innovative approach to designing teaching methods and investigating the effects of this framework. The purpose of this study was to develop analyze, observe, reflect, conceive, design, implement, and operate (Crawley et al., 2007) a DT-CDIO model and to investigate the relationship of the flow experience to computational thinking and cognitive load in order to understand the impact of the flow experience on a flipped programming course.

This study was intended to obtain and evaluate significant differences between the students' flow experience and their computational thinking ability and cognitive load. The results indicated that the DT-CDIO pedagogy filled a long-standing gap related to a lack of reflective pedagogy and design thinking problems. The flow experience negatively impacted creativity and problem solving ability. Meanwhile, intrinsic cognitive load negatively impacted the flow experience.

article,BENVENUTI2023107903,"Despite the significant emphasis placed on incorporating 21st century skills into the educational framework, particularly at the primary level, recent scholarly works indicate considerable variation in the implementation of these skills across different countries and regions, suggesting a demand for further research specifically focusing on primary education. The indications of the Digicomp framework and 21st-century skills in Europe have outlined the key competences for lifelong learning needed for all citizens, including teachers and students. In this perspective, Education plays a fundamental role in ensuring that citizens acquire the required skills. The objective in the common European framework is clear: to initiate a transition from the culture of knowledge to the culture of competence. Nowadays, technological advancement allows the researchers to create and combine different frameworks with the perspective of an even more tailored, and engaged education, some examples derived from the implementation of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), in the combination of Gamification and AI, or the development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) to foster and create an even more personalized learning and teaching.

Thirty Children aged 10–11 years, from a primary school in London took part in a game-making project using the Scratch and Alice 2.4 applications for eight months. For the focus of this specific paper, data from participant observations, informal conversations, problem-solving sheets, semi-structured interviews and children’s completed games were used to make sense of elements of the computational thinking process and approaches to evaluate these elements in a computer game design context. The discussions around what CT consists, highlighted the complex structure of computational thinking and the interaction between the elements of artificial intelligence (AI), computer, cognitive, learning and psychological sciences. This also emphasised the role of metacognition in the Computational Thinking process. These arguments illustrated that it is not possible to evaluate Computational Thinking using only programming constructs, as CT process provides opportunities for developing many other skills and concepts. Therefore a multiple evaluation approach should be adopted to illustrate the full learning scope of the Computational Thinking Process. Using the support of literature review and the findings of the data analysis I proposed a multiple approach evaluation model where ‘computational concepts’, ‘metacognitive practices’, and ‘learning behaviours’ were discussed as the main elements of the CT process.

article,ROMANGONZALEZ201847,"Computational thinking (CT) is arising as a set of problem-solving skills that must be acquired by the new generations of students to fully understand and participate in our computer-based world. However, from a psychometric approach, we are still at an early stage regarding the definition and assessment of CT as a psychological variable. One way to advance in this area is to investigate whether ‘computationally talented’ students (i.e., ‘computational top thinkers’) can be detected even before learning to code; and, if so, how to teach them properly to fully develop their high-computational ability. This paper presents several empirical concatenated studies about the predictive validity of the Computational Thinking Test (CTt), which is administered on a sample of 314 middle school Spanish students (n=314). We report the predictive validity of the CTt, conducted at the beginning of the quarter, with respect to academic performance (Informatics, Mathematics, and Language) and learning analytics in a Code.org course collected at the end of the quarter. We also analyze the predictive validity of the CTt to early distinguish between ‘computational regular thinkers’ and ‘computational top thinkers’ (i.e., those who spontaneously accelerated from the ‘block-based’ programming environment of Code.org to the ‘text-based’ one of Khan Academy). Finally, we perform a case study over two of the students categorized as ‘computational top thinkers’, in which one of their coding products written in Processing JavaScript is described. Our results demonstrate that ‘computationally talented’ students can be detected in middle school, and that these subjects have the ability to accelerate in the Computer Science Education standards between 1 and 2 years compared to the regular learners.

However, courses that can guide students through the practical applications of AI technology are still scarce in K-12 education. This study aimed to develop a project-based machine learning (ML) course for the implementation of AI technology. The core idea of this course, which focused on the supervised learning of AI ML technology, was designed based on the project of weather prediction. Furthermore, data collection and status display were realized using various hardware devices such as Arduino and sensors, whereas ML algorithms were implemented in Python programming language. A total of 68 eleventh-grade senior high school students from a public school in Southern Taiwan participated in this study. The main variables included understanding AI concepts, computational thinking (CT), and learning attitude. Data were analyzed using quantitative statistics, including descriptive statistics, t-test, and analysis of covariance, supplemented with qualitative data. Based on the findings, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) the proposed course on the implementation of ML helps students understand the basic concepts of AI; (2) students demonstrate a significant improvement in CT skills after attending this course; (3) although the students’ attitude toward learning AI shows no significant change after attending this course, their overall view for it is positive; (4) contrary to their learning attitude, the CT skills among the students with different capabilities of learning AI are significantly dissimilar. Overall, the machine-learning implementation course developed in this study can serve as a reference for promoting AI education in the future.

Ten-year-old children are able to devise such programs to rearrange the order of the cars in trains on a simple railway track with a single siding. According to the theory, they rely on kinematic mental models that simulate the required sequence of steps, and we devised a computer program, mAbducer, which does so too in creating its own programs for such rearrangements. An experiment showed that a simple measure of the complexity of its programs, based on Kolmogorov complexity, predicts ten-year-olds’ difficulty in this task: the measure is the number of words in mAbducer’s programs for solving the rearrangement in a minimal number of moves. Complexity, in turn, reflects the structure of the required programs, which need loops of moves to be repeated, and often moves before and after such a loop.

article,SUN2023101340,"Promoting computational thinking (CT) skills in programming activities has become a key issue in K-12 education, and the shift from visual to text-based programming is an inevitable trend in programming education. Although research on K-12 text-based programming to promote CT skills has been increasing, a literature review that systematically organizes and analyzes it has not yet emerged. Moreover, there are no uniform conclusions on how to design text-based programming activities to effectively promote students’ acquisition of CT skills. The purpose of this study was mainly to determine the effectiveness of using text-based programming to enhance K-12 students’ CT skills, to explore the effects of various text-based programming instructional design factors on CT skill acquisition, and to discuss the key issues and future development of text programming in the K-12 stage. In this study using the quantitative method of meta-analysis and the qualitative method of systematic literature review, 46 studies of text-based programming on K-12 students’ CT skills were retrieved, of which 19 empirical studies including 37 effects size met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis and were therefore used as a meta-analysis. The results showed that text-based programming improved the CT skills of K-12 students overall (Hedges’ g = 0.71, 95% CI [0.51, 0.90], p < 0.01). No publication bias was detected. In addition, the results of the moderator analysis revealed that: 1) text programming had the greatest impact on computational thinking development in middle school students (g = 0.833, p = <0.05); 2) the duration of text programming instruction had the most significant positive impact on students' CT at 16–20 weeks (g = 1.038, p <0.05); 3) the moderating effect of different assessment tools on CT skills in text programming instruction The difference was statistically significant, and the test assessment method had a highly significant positive moderating effect on CT skills of students in grades K-12 (g = 1.005, p < 0.05); 4) The moderating effect of different student sample sizes on students' computational thinking development was significantly different, and the implementation of text-based programming instruction had the most significant effect on students' CT improvement among students with sample sizes of 41 ∼ 60 (g = 0.921, p < 0.05); 5) There were no significant differences in the effects of different text-based programming languages and learning environments on students' computational thinking.However, there are still barriers to developing instructional practices for text-based programming to foster CT in K-12 students, such as the highly abstract and complex syntax of text-based programming. This study found that the most critical issues that need to be addressed in current text-based programming to foster CT in K-12 students are the lack of student interest in text-based programming and the misconceptions that arise when students move from visual programming to text-based programming.

In this study, a meta-review of the studies published in academic journals from 2006 to 2017 was conducted to analyze application courses, adopted learning strategies, participants, teaching tools, programming languages, and course categories of CT education. From the review results, it was found that the promotion of CT in education has made great progress in the last decade. In addition to the increasing number of CT studies in different countries, the subjects, research issues, and teaching tools have also become more diverse in recent years. It was also found that CT has mainly been applied to the activities of program design and computer science, while some studies are related to other subjects. Meanwhile, most of the studies adopted Project-Based Learning, Problem-Based Learning, Cooperative Learning, and Game-based Learning in the CT activities. In other words, such activities as aesthetic experience, design-based learning, and storytelling have been relatively less frequently adopted. Most of the studies focused on programming skills training and mathematical computing, while some adopted a cross-domain teaching mode to enable students to manage and analyze materials of various domains by computing. In addition, since the cognitive ability of students of different ages varies, the CT ability cultivation methods and content criteria should vary accordingly.

Software Engineering is dedicated to the systematic and efficient development of software, which necessitates the active participation of all team members and a recognition of their unique skills and abilities, including those with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The inclusion of individuals with ASD presents new perspectives, yet there is a lack of systematic evidence regarding the primary obstacles and potential benefits associated with their inclusion.
Objective:
This paper aims to identify, characterize, and describe barriers, facilitators, and methodological proposals described by the community to include individuals with ASD in the discipline of Software Engineering.
Methods:
We conducted a comprehensive systematic multivocal mapping study to evaluate the existing evidence on the inclusion of individuals with ASD in Software Engineering.
Results:
We obtained 34 primary studies from which we identified the main facilitators of motivation to learn new skills, attention to detail, and the ability to report and visualize patterns. In contrast, the main barriers detected were communication, a lack of neurodivergent computational thinking, and sensory integration. Additionally, we identified and classified four categories of proposals that allowed the inclusion of individuals with ASD: (i) using virtual reality, (ii) creating more inclusive workspaces, (iii) encouraging neurodivergent computational thinking, and (iv) improving social skills.

In recent years, the availability of free and user-friendly programming languages has fuelled the interest of researchers and educators to explore how computational thinking can be introduced in K-12 contexts. Through an analysis of 27 available intervention studies, this paper presents the current trends of empirical research in the development of computational thinking through programming and suggests possible research and instructional implications. From the review, we propose that more K-12 intervention studies centering on computational practices and computational perspectives could be conducted in the regular classroom. To better examine these two dimensions, students could be asked to verbalize their thought process using think aloud protocol while programming and their on-screen programming activity could be captured and analyzed. Predetermined categories based on both past and recent programming studies could be used to guide the analysis of the qualitative data.

CT is a problem solving process essential to the development of computer applications, but it is also used in supporting problem solving across many other disciplines. It has gained some grounds in secondary education in the last few years and there are ongoing efforts to introduce it to elementary education as well. Taking into consideration that algorithms play a central role in computational thinking, the aim of our research was to assess the skills of secondary school students and university students in this area, CT, that they faced an apparently computer science – free task but with obvious algorithmic background. According to the aims of our research there were two target populations: secondary school students and university students. In order to measure the level of computational thinking we elaborated a worksheet (test with problems to be solved). The tasks contained algorithms that can be applied on computer, and they did not need any IT knowledge, only structured and logical thinking.

article,WOO2022101193,"Problem solving capabilities have often been reported by teachers as a key benefit from creative coding activities in school-age children. However, few studies to date have defined problem solving, and investigated how it is operationalised in interdisciplinary creative coding tasks. This study aims to build knowledge about students’ use of computational thinking and computer science concepts for problem solving when coding animated narratives. The research investigated students’ coding processes using data gathered from audio and device display recordings and semi-structured interviews. Results suggest limitations to the use of creative coding tasks if the expectation is to develop computational thinking and systematic problem solving strategies, or learn basic computer science concepts. They revealed that novice students rarely solved coding problems using optimal technically-based strategies despite being given explicit instruction on their use, opting instead to bypass problems by adjusting intended outcomes, or by using low level code translation strategies. Results demonstrate that engaging computational thinking or even demonstrating understanding of basic computer science concepts was not a requirement to produce a viable creative coding outcome. This study contributes new understanding of students’ coding practices when engaged in creative coding tasks in regular, non-specialist classrooms. Its findings challenge the commonly-held assumption that coding is a natural ‘vehicle’ to develop computational thinking and systematic approaches to problem solving.

One approach to provide these opportunities is to focus on social game play. Understanding game play is common across a range of media and ages. Children can begin by solving puzzles on paper, continue on game boards, and ultimately complete their solutions on computers. Through this process, learners can be guided through increasingly complex algorithmic thinking activities that are built from their tacit knowledge and excitement about game play. This paper describes our approach to teaching computational thinking skills without traditional programming—but instead by building on children’s existing game playing interest and skills. We built a system called CTArcade, with an initial game (Tic-Tac-Toe), which we evaluated with 18 children aged 10–15.

It then discusses the thinking process of algorithm selection and problem decomposition. For a given problem the programmer will typically have to select from a variety of algorithms. Some of these algorithms achieve different tradeoffs while maintaining the same numerical accuracy. Others involve sacrificing some level of accuracy to achieve much more scalable running times. For the selected algorithm, different choices of problem decomposition can result in different levels of interference between threads, parallelism exposed, load imbalance, and other performance considerations during parallel execution.

As one of the mainstream forms of programming education activities, unplugged programming activities are mainly implemented in the early stage of basic education. However, considering the lack of programming experience among Chinese junior high schoolers and the uneven distribution of programming education resources, an 8-week quasi-experimental study was conducted to verify the effectiveness of unplugged activities in improving junior high schoolers’ CT skills, and to identify the influence of multiple factors. A total of 93 7th-graders volunteered to participate in the experiment: 62 students were divided into two experimental groups, which were intervened by unplugged activities to repeat the results’ reliability, and 31 students were used as the control group without any unplugged programming activities. The results of the intra-group and inter-group comparison show that unplugged programming is a more effective way to improve 7th-graders’ CT skills. Students’ mathematic performance and previous programming experience had a significant impact on their CT skills, but this impact is not reflected in the process of unplugged programming activities. It can be said that all students can develop their CT skills through unplugged programming activities, regardless of their learning background. In the current context, unplugged programming activities can be used as an effective way for junior high schoolers to improve and develop their CT skills.

A quasi-experimental non-equivalent groups design was utilized where 70 students were assigned into the experimental group, and 36 students were assigned into the control group. The experimental group was given intervention with CT-infused activities both on- and off-computer, while the control group received no such intervention. Both groups were administered the pretest before the intervention and the posttest after the intervention. The data gathered were analyzed using the partial credit version of the Rasch model. Analysis of pretest and posttest results revealed that the performance of the experimental group was similar to the control group. The findings did not support the hypothesis that integrating CT in lessons can result in improved mathematics learning.

article,RELKIN2021104222,"This longitudinal study examined changes in Computational Thinking (CT) skills in first and second grade students exposed to a developmentally appropriate coding curriculum. The “Coding as Another Language” (CAL) curriculum spans seven weeks and uses the KIBO robot to engage students in learning that integrates programming and literacy concepts. We compared children receiving CAL (N = 667) to a control group (N = 181) who participated in typical classroom activities without coding (No-CAL). TechCheck, a validated “unplugged” CT assessment suitable for young children regardless of their coding experience, was used to measure CT. Over the course of the study, children who received CAL-KIBO improved on TechCheck (Mchange = 0.94, p < .001) whereas the No-CAL group did not change significantly (Mchange = 0.27, p = .07). Accounting for demographic factors, baseline performance and classroom (teacher) effects, CAL exposure was a significant predictor of post-test CT scores (p < .01). Improvements in CT measured by TechCheck over seven weeks of the CAL-KIBO curriculum were consistent with approximately six months of development without coding instruction. Secondary analysis stratified by grade revealed decisive evidence that CAL exposure improved scores in first grade and anecdotal evidence that second grade scores improved. The CT domains that showed improvement in children who received CAL-KIBO included algorithms, modularity, and representation. Young children who learned to code improved in solving unplugged problems that were not explicitly taught in the coding curriculum.

One of these pathways consists of modifying and sharing versions of projects that other members of the community have created, but few researchers have investigated how it might be applied to primary school pupils.

article,ROMANGONZALEZ2018441,"Computational thinking (CT) is being consolidated as a key set of problem-solving skills that must be developed by the students to excel in our software-driven society. However, in psychological terms, CT is still a poorly defined construct, given that its nomological network has not been established yet. In a previous paper, we started to address this issue studying the correlations between CT and some fundamental cognitive variables, such as primary mental abilities and problem-solving ability. The current work deepens in the same direction as it aims to extend the nomological network of CT with non-cognitive factors, through the study of the correlations between CT, self-efficacy and the several dimensions from the ‘Big Five’ model of human personality: Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. To do so, the Computational Thinking Test (CTt) and some additional self-efficacy items are administered on a sample of 1251 Spanish students from 5th to 10th grade (N = 1251), and the Big Five Questionnaire-Children version (BFQ-C) is also taken by a subsample from the above (n = 99). Results show statistically significant correlations between CT and self-efficacy perception relative to CT performance (rs = 0.41), in which gender differences in favor of males are found (d = 0.42). Moreover, results show statistically significant correlations between CT and: Openness to Experience (r = 0.41), Extraversion (r = 0.30), and Conscientiousness (r = 0.27). These findings are consistent with the existing literature except for the unexpected correlation between CT and the Extraversion factor of personality, which is consequently discussed in detail.

Yet, more research is needed to better understand how to help elementary school students acquire CT skills effectively. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of partial pair programming (PPP) on elementary school students' CT skills and self-efficacy (SE). The study included four 4th grade classes, with a total of 171 students, who were taking the course entitled “Computational Thinking with Scratch” with the same teacher for one semester. Two classes (84 students) were in the Experimental Group (EG, 44 boys and 40 girls) while two other classes (87 students) were in the Control Group (CG, 45 boys and 42 girls). The students in the EG were paired up for the programming assignments while the students in the CG did the assignments on their own.

article,CESAR2017116,"Nowadays, many fields of science and engineering are evolving through the joint contribution of complementary fields. Computer science, and especially High Performance Computing, has become a key factor in the development of many research fields, establishing a new paradigm called computational science. Researchers and professionals from many different fields require knowledge of High Performance Computing, including parallel programming, to develop fruitful and efficient work in their particular field. Therefore, at Universitat Autònoma of Barcelona (Spain), an interdisciplinary Master on “Modeling for Science and Engineering” was started 5 years ago to provide a thorough knowledge of the application of modeling and simulation to graduate students in different fields (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Geology, etc.). In this Master’s degree, “Parallel Programming” appears as a compulsory subject because it is a key topic for them. The concepts learned in this subject must be applied to real applications. Therefore, a complementary subject on “Applied Modeling and Simulation” has also been included. It is very important to show the students how to analyze their particular problems, think about them from a computational perspective and consider the related performance issues. So, in this paper, the methodology and the experience in introducing computational thinking, parallel programming and performance engineering in this interdisciplinary Master’s degree are shown. This overall approach has been refined through the Master’s life, leading to excellent academic results and improving the industry and students appraisal of this programme.",,Eduardo Cesar and Ana Cortés and Antonio Espinosa and Tomàs Margalef and Juan Carlos Moure and Anna Sikora and Remo Suppi,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2016.12.027,,,,0743-7315,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,"Parallel programming, Message passing, Shared memory, GPUs, MPI, OpenMP, CUDA, Agent-based models, Model simulation",,116-126,,"Introducing computational thinking, parallel programming and performance engineering in interdisciplinary studies",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743731517300059,105.0,2017,"Keeping up with Technology: Teaching Parallel, Distributed and High-Performance Computing",
article,OCAK2023100146,"Multimodal video analysis is a complex and time-consuming process for a researcher; it entails capturing, watching, and re-watching video data to identify which segments best inform or address the questions that drive the research. Modern AI applications can alleviate the challenges that arise during the fine-grained analysis of learners' multimodal interactions captured through video. In this study, we present a supervised approach to training a deep neural network to analyze children's computational thinking (CT) captured through multimodal video data. The approach first uses a set of images extracted from video data to train the AI to map them to labels generated using a priori theory. Confusion matrices were used to establish the performance of the AI by comparing AI predictions to human analysis on a validation set of data. The findings suggested that the AI classified several aspects of children's CT in a way that was highly consistent with human analysis, demonstrating how the AI could serve as an additional team member during multimodal analysis.

article,CHEVALIER2022104431,"Computational thinking (CT) is considered an emerging competence domain linked to 21st-century competences, and educational robotics (ER) is increasingly recognised as a tool to develop CT competences. This is why researchers recommend developing intervention methods adapted to classroom practice and providing explicit guidelines to teachers on integrating ER activities. The present study thus addresses this challenge. Guidance and feedback were considered as critical intervention methods to foster CT competences in ER settings. A between-subjects experiment was conducted with 66 students aged 8 to 9 in the context of a remote collaborative robot programming mission, with four experimental conditions. A two-step strategy was employed to report students' CT competence (their performance and learning process). Firstly, the students' CT learning gains were measured through a pre-post-test design. Secondly, video analysis was used to identify the creative computational problem-solving patterns involved in the experimental condition that had the most favourable impact on the students’ CT scores. Results show that delayed feedback is an effective intervention method for CT development in ER activities.

article,LOVE2022100543,"In recent years there has been a growing emphasis placed on access to computational thinking (CT) instruction for every K-12 student in the United States (U.S.). Concurrently, calls for integrating CT concepts within authentic science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) contexts have also increased. This is reflected by the inclusion of CT in the Next Generation Science Standards and the Standards for Technological and Engineering Literacy. However, methods for teaching CT concepts within secondary level STEM courses vary drastically. Physical computing, the design and programming of physical systems or devices using computational thinking skills, has become increasingly popular in the U.S. in attempts to integrate CT within authentic STEM problem-solving contexts. Despite this rise in popularity, there remains a limited but growing body of research investigating physical computing pedagogy and student learning. A mixed methods design was used in this study to examine 170 middle school students’ attitudes toward coding and after participating in either a screen-based or physical computing unit. The results indicated that students who completed the screen-based unit reported statistically greater attitudes toward the classroom applications and career/future use of computing concepts. Students in the treatment group believed that physical computing made learning computing concepts more difficult, but they preferred the hands-on learning opportunities provided by physical computing. Furthermore, male students reported higher attitudinal ratings than females regarding the influence computing would have on their future academic and career choices.

article,GUGGEMOS2021104060,"Computational thinking (CT) is a key 21st-century skill. This paper contributes to CT research by investigating CT predictors among upper secondary students in a longitudinal and natural classroom setting. The hypothesized predictors are grouped into three areas: student characteristics, home environment, and learning opportunities. CT is measured with the Computational Thinking Test (CTt), an established performance test. N = 202 high-school students, at three time points over one school year, act as the sample and latent growth curve modeling as the analysis method. CT self-concept, followed by reasoning skills and gender, show the strongest association with the level of CT. Computer literacy, followed by duration of computer use and formal learning opportunities during the school year, have the strongest association with CT growth. Variables from all three areas seem to be important for predicting either CT level or growth. An explained variance of 70.4% for CT level and 61.2% for CT growth might indicate a good trade-off between the comprehensiveness and parsimony of the conceptual framework.

article,XU2024100415,"With the increasing importance of equipping young learners with computational thinking skills through learning to code, pair programming has emerged as a prevalent collaborative learning strategy in this context. Successful pair programming interventions necessitate mutual engagement between partners within a dyad. However, the measurement of mutual engagement in dyadic collaborative learning remains an under-researched area. This research represents a foundational stage in bridging this gap by developing a comprehensive 20-item Pair-Programming Mutual Engagement Questionnaire (PPME-Q) as a measure of mutual engagement in pair programming at the activity level. The questionnaire was validated through a sample of 86 eighth-grade students. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the existence of a four-factor structure comprising of the behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and social engagement factors. The findings demonstrate the validity (χ2/df = 1.32) and reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.888) of the PPME-Q, establishing it as an effective tool for assessing eighth graders' mutual engagement in pair programming activities. As this tool is in the nascent stages of development the measurement, we emphasize the need for further empirical studies to establish criterion validity.

article,GU2024825,"Recognized as the crown jewel of system software, Operating System (OS) is notoriously challenging to teach and learn, given its abstract concepts, broad scope, and the imperative for hands-on experience. How to cater to the keen interest in OS among students across all universities while providing a rich system software engineering experience? Engaging the OS community on campus plays a pivotal role in enhancing undergraduate education. Our institution has implemented a novel approach over the past nine years through the miniOS pilot class initiative. This program allows students enrolled in the OS course to opt into an additional, practical component where they engage in developing the OS kernel using miniOS, our teaching platform. Participants dedicate their spare time to a series of labs aimed at incrementally introducing them to miniOS, collaborate on a project to add a new functional module to miniOS, and ultimately present their work in a formal defense. This hands-on experience supplements the theoretical coursework, with the notable advantage that pilot class participants are exempt from the traditional final exam.

article,SRIHARI20141083,"Several automation tools have been developed over the years for forensic document examination (FDE) of handwritten items. Integrating the developed tools into a unified framework is considered and the essential role of the human in the process is discussed. The task framework is developed by considering the approach of computational thinking whose components are abstraction, algorithms, mathematical models and ability to scale. Beginning with the human FDE procedure expressed in algorithmic form, mathematical and software implementations of individual steps of the algorithm are described. Advantages of the framework are discussed, including efficiency (ability to scale to tasks with many handwritten items), reproducibility and validation/improvement of existing manual procedures. It is indicated that as with other expert systems, such as for medical diagnosis, current automation tools are useful only as part of a larger manually intensive procedure. This viewpoint is illustrated with a well-known FDE case, concerning the Lindbergh kidnapping with a new hypothesis – in this case, there are multiple questioned documents, possibility of multiple writers of the same document, determining whether the writing is disguised, known writing is formal while questioned writing is informal, etc. Observations are made for future developments, where human examiners provide handwriting characteristics while computational methods provide the necessary statistical analysis.",,Sargur N.

The subscriber can be thought of as a person or a group of users using a network service or connectivity. The DPI features represent the subscriber network usage, and the ensemble learning approach is implemented on the DPI dataset to predict the subscriber's service category on the network. The classification and prediction problem addressed on the DPI dataset reached a precision of 100%.

article,GENTILE20221,"The mental rotation ability is an essential spatial reasoning skill in human cognition and has proven to be an essential predictor of mathematical and STEM skills, critical and computational thinking. Despite its importance, little is known about when and how mental rotation processes are activated in games explicitly targeting spatial reasoning tasks. In particular, the relationship between spatial abilities and TetrisTM has been analysed several times in the literature. However, these analyses have shown contrasting results between the effectiveness of Tetris-based training activities to improve mental rotation skills. In this work, we studied whether, and under what conditions, such ability is used in the TetrisTM game by explicitly modelling mental rotation via an ACT-R based cognitive model controlling a virtual agent. The obtained results show meaningful insights into the activation of mental rotation during game dynamics. The study suggests the necessity to adapt game dynamics in order to force the activation of this process and, therefore, can be of inspiration to design learning activities based on TetrisTM or re-design the game itself to improve its educational effectiveness.",,Manuel Gentile and Antonio Lieto,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogsys.2021.12.005,,,,1389-0417,Cognitive Systems Research,"Cognitive architectures, ACT-R, Mental rotation, Tetris, Serious games design",,1-11,,The role of mental rotation in TetrisTM gameplay: An ACT-R computational cognitive model,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389041721000991,73,2022,,

article,FOSTER2018144,"This paper outlines some provisional steps toward a theory of culture grounded in computational thinking. I begin by describing computational thinking, drawing on Marr’s hierarchy for the analysis of information processing systems. I then address the definition of culture, arguing that culture is a property of causal chains, rather than a thing-in-the-world. I briefly address contemporary debates over the nature of culture—embodied versus embedded—and argue for an ecological approach in which culture-in-action unfolds as embodied schemas recognize (and produce) “handles” in the environment. When schemas are “objectively adapted” to the handles, they generate action that is ecologically rational. To explain ecologically rational culture-in-action, I outline a formal approach to cultural learning based on Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-learning theory.

Computational intelligence (CI) is the ability of a machine to learn specific tasks via data or experimental observation for understanding and analysing customer behavioural patterns. Thus, this study explores how e-customers may intend to adopt CI in e-commerce within the boundaries of IM. Using online surveys, the primary data were collected from 315 e-customers of e-commerce businesses. Subsequently, the quantitative approach was used to analyse the data. The finding reveals that using a variety of techniques such as fuzzy logic, learning theory, evolutionary computation, genetic algorithms, and deep learning, CI predicts e-customer behaviour in a changing environment. Such a prediction results in desirable impacts, including more successful IM campaigns and retention actions. Further, CI uses a computational thinking approach, including the specification of the problem, algorithmic expression, solution implementation, and solution evaluation, for the identification and classification of stock-keeping units.

article,LIN2024101450,"In the context of digital transformation, educators are seeking ways to guide students to become innovative technology designers. However, students often lack innovative problem-solving skills when working with IT, and so new pedagogies are needed to improve IT-related curricula. Design thinking (DT), as a methodology, may offer the potential to meet this need. The present study developed a DT-based framework for the design of IT learning projects. A quasi-experiment was conducted in a junior middle school, employing both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods to explore the impact of DT on learning outcomes and mechanisms that explain the observed changes in student performance. The findings demonstrate that DT promotes creativity in students’ digital works, especially their value, diversity, and originality. DT also enhances students’ awareness of using IT to address daily challenges and facilitates their basic information knowledge and skills. Regarding the mechanisms, the DT process and tools serve as learning scaffolds and facilitate the creativity of digital work. The Ideate of DT generates ideas on what to do and how to do it. Empathize and Define establish a link between digital work and real-life problems. Prototype and Test help students acquire basic information knowledge and skills.

There is a critical need to understand how to attract Black girls and other girls of color to the science, technology, engineering, math, and computer science (STEM+CS) field. This study aims to look at the design and implementation of a CS learning ecosystem that supports girls of color in acquiring critical CS skills starting in middle school.
Design/methodology/approach
This mixed-method case study included 53 girls, between the ages of 11 and 13, in four US middle schools. Study methods included the analysis of a pre-program student survey, longitudinal interviews and focus groups, weekly observations and computing artifacts.
Findings
Program participants were interested in CS, were confident in their ability to learn CS, had prior coding and CS experience and had parents and teachers who encouraged them to learn CS. But some students showed dependent learning behaviors while engaging in CS activities. These included relying on instructors and being reticent to make mistakes–behaviors that limit learning. The CS learning ecosystem supported students as they shifted from applying dependent learning approaches to applying independent learning approaches. Instructors sustained a growth mindset and supported productive struggle as students learned CS skills.

The results of this study provide insights regarding the past and future trends of core discussion topics in computational science and show how “computational thinking” has propagated across different fields of study. We used the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) topic modelling algorithm to discover topics. The resulting topics were then manually labelled and grouped hierarchically on three levels. Next, we applied trend analysis and Change Point Analysis (CPA) to study the evolution of topics over seventeen years and to identify the growing and disappearing topics. We used Gephi to examine the static networks of topics, and an R library called DyA to analyse the dynamic networks of topics.

article,MANNILA2023100132,"The technological development has raised awareness for the importance of digital competence and computational thinking (CT) to understand the digital world and has resulted in revised curricula in many countries. In Finland, a new curriculum for grades 1–9 came into force in 2016 introducing digital competence (including programming) to be integrated in other subjects. Most teachers lack prior experience in programming and there is a need for suitable instructional models. This article presents a cross-curricular teaching sequence and the results from a case study conducted in four Finnish schools. Students in grades 4–6 collaboratively worked on a project combining arts, design and CT with other subjects. The results show that students demonstrated several CT abilities while working on their projects, in particular creativity, tinkering and debugging. The findings also indicate that teachers and students learned together (co-agency) and suggest that models like the teaching sequence can help and encourage teachers to integrate programming and CT in a cross-curricular manner. Still, the teachers’ knowledge, ambition level and understanding of the task at hand, as well as the organizational support appear to play a notable role when planning and carrying out projects of this kind. While CT is commonly seen as developed through programming, the teaching sequence seems to have fostered CT abilities through the project as a whole, with programming playing the role of a tool or a glue depending on the time available, and the students’ skill and ambition level.",,Linda Mannila and Teemu Leinonen and Merja Bauters and Marjaana Veermans,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeo.2023.100132,,,,2666-5573,Computers and Education Open,"K-12 education, Computational thinking, Cross-curricular projects, Arts and design",,100132,,Student and teacher co-agency when combining CT with arts and design in a cross-curricular project,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666557323000101,4,2023,,
article,MACRIDES2022100396,"The current study aims to provide a systematic review of the literature about the teaching of programming in early-childhood education, and specifically for the age group of 3–8 years old. The review presents empirical investigations with young learners and reports on relevant frameworks and curriculum programs, effects of teaching approaches and educational tools on learning, and learning outcomes and pedagogical benefits of teaching programming. Based on the empirical studies reviewed in this study, programming can be introduced to young learners as a stand-alone subject matter or can be integrated in the regular kindergarten curriculum with other subject areas such as music, movement and dance, art, science, mathematics, and literacy. In addition, programming can be infused in literacy and storytelling activities as a developmentally appropriate delivery approach.

article,PAPAVLASOPOULOU201850,"Computational thinking and coding for children are attracting increasing attention. There are several efforts around the globe to implement coding frameworks for children, and there is a need to develop an empirical knowledge base of methods and tools. One major problem for integrating study results into a common body of knowledge is the relatively limited measurements applied, and the relation of the widely used self-reporting methods with more objective measurements, such as biophysical ones. In this study, eye-tracking activity was used to measure children’s learning and activity indicators. The goal of the study is to utilize eye-tracking to understand children’s activity while they learn how to code and to investigate any potential association between children’s attitudes and their gaze. In this contribution, we designed an experiment with 44 children (between 8 and 17 years old) who participated in a full-day construction-based coding activity. We recorded their gaze while they were working and captured their attitudes in relation to their learning, excitement and intention. The results showed a significant relation between children’s attitudes (what they think about coding) and their gaze patterns (how they behaved during coding). Eye-tracking data provide initial insights into the behaviour of children, for example if children have difficulty in extracting information or fail to accomplish an expected task.

Data revealed that students' support needs during computing activities were not CT-specific. Rather, supports specific to these students' needs that were successful in other educational areas were also successful and sufficient in CT. Although additional studies would need to be conducted to ascertain the transferability of these findings to other contexts and students, our results contribute evidence that students with disabilities can and should participate in CT and be provided with the supports they need, just as in all other areas of the curriculum.

As shown, the applicative prestructure (objects-as-processes, application) generates an applicative structure (processes, application, values), which ensures the generation of the result — the value of interactions, enabling the process of evaluation. The theory of combinators is used as the main (meta)mathematical means.

Yet, little is known about the effects of these skills on children's cognitive development. In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, we examined how 1st-grade children's gains in coding skills that follow instructional intervention transfer to two important executive functions (EFs): planning and response inhibition. One-hundred seventy-nine (179) first graders from 5 schools and 10 class groups, with no prior experience of coding, were randomly assigned to an experimental (coding, 5 classes) or control (standard STEM, 5 classes) instructional condition. The experimental intervention involved 8 h of coding activities (two weekly lessons for 4 weeks), through the Code.org platform. Children in the control group were exposed to standard STEM instruction. Four coding tasks drawn from Code.org, two standardized planning tasks (Elithorn maze test and Tower of London, ToL, test) and two standardized response inhibition tasks (NEPSY-II inhibition subtest and numerical Stroop), were used to assess children's skills at the pretest and posttest (after the instructional intervention). To measure retention, the same skills were also assessed for 44 children from the experimental group 5 weeks from the posttest (follow up). The results show that practice with coding through Code.org not only improved measurably children's ability to solve coding problems, but also their EFs, increasing the time children spent planning, their ability to solve standardized planning tasks, and to inhibit prepotent responses.

This gap calls for attention in design processes, principles and practices that are attentive to ethical considerations and values-based approaches. On the other hand, in its formulation STEAM as an educational approach is framed in four fundamental pillars: creativity, inclusion, citizenship and emerging technologies, which also put attention on the inclusion of disadvantaged and underrepresented social groups during STEAM education design.

article,STOLPE2024100159,"The interest in artificial intelligence (AI) in education has erupted during the last few years, primarily due to technological advances in AI. It is therefore argued that students should learn about AI, although it is debated exactly how it should be applied in education. AI literacy has been suggested as a way of defining competencies for students to acquire to meet a future everyday- and working life with AI. This study argues that researchers and educators need a framework for integrating AI literacy into technological literacy, where the latter is viewed as a multiliteracy. This study thus aims to critically analyse and discuss different components of AI literacy found in the literature in relation to technological literacy. The data consists of five AI literacy frameworks related to three traditions of technological knowledge: technical skills, technological scientific knowledge, and socio-ethical technical understanding. The results show that AI literacy for technology education emphasises technological scientific knowledge (e.g., knowledge about what AI is, how to recognise AI, and systems thinking) and socio-ethical technical understanding (e.g., AI ethics and the role of humans in AI). Technical skills such as programming competencies also appear but are less emphasised. Implications for technology education are also discussed, and a framework for AI literacy for technology education is suggested.",,Karin Stolpe and Jonas Hallström,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeo.2024.100159,,,,2666-5573,Computers and Education Open,"AI literacy, Ethical issues, AI in education",,100159,,Artificial intelligence literacy for technology education,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666557324000016,6,2024,,
article,LANDAU2024101463,"Block construction is ubiquitous in early development, yet is surprisingly complex, involving step-by-step sequenced actions to create specific structures. Here, we use novel analytic methods to characterize these action sequences in detail, including which individual parts of the structure (‘states’) are built and how these structures are combined, creating a fully specified build path towards the final structure. We find that, like adults tested in a previous study, 4- to 8-year-olds build by creating a small subset of possible individual states and full build paths, and that they prioritize building layer-by-layer. The individual states and build paths that children produce are strikingly similar to those of adults, resulting in structures that are more stable than other possible (but not attested) states and paths. Our approach serves as a lens into the cognitive processes underlying block building and suggests that children’s building is guided by significant cognitive constraints consistent with “computational thinking”.",,Barbara Landau and E.

The intervention takes place in two academic years analyzing the practice of integrating coding and visual blocks programming in sciences and arts. The “Computational concepts and computational practices” dimension details a quasi-experimental approach, which showed significant improvement regarding learning programming concepts, logic, and computational practices with an active approach. The “Learning processes and coding in primary education” dimension analyzes the practice of the experimental group through questionnaires and structured observation. In this pedagogical design, students interact and create their own content related to curricular areas with several advantages, such as motivation, fun, commitment, and enthusiasm, showing improvements related to computational thinking and computational practices. Understanding of computational concepts through an active approach, Project Based Learning, usefulness, motivation, and commitment underline the importance and effectiveness of implementing a Visual Programming Language from active methodologies in primary education.

article,EGBERT2021104173,"Several gaps exist in the literature on coding. First, little exploration has focused on early elementary school students. In addition, close description of the overall context of coding tasks at this level is rare. Further, there is a need for both teacher and student voices around coding experiences to be heard. Moreover, a task engagement framework has not been used to evaluate the process or outcomes of early elementary coding tasks. Therefore, an exploratory holistic case study design was used to investigate student and teacher processes and outcomes of coding lessons in order to fill gaps in the literature. In this study, forty-six 2nd grade students, two teachers, and four researchers completed two one-week units on basic coding. Multiple descriptive and numeric data sources were employed to describe the process and outcomes of learning coding. Conclusions include: (1) teachers should start learning about coding first with short awareness sessions and then move to their own classrooms with knowledge brokers and other forms of assistance; (2) a focus on content and process, including problem-solving, is effective for coding with young children; (3) there can be a high level of engagement for teachers and students with the use of robots and welldesigned, age-appropriate coding tasks, and; (4) multiple data sources and the inclusion of both teacher and student data are essential in exploring coding in classrooms.",,Joy Egbert and Seyed Abdollah Shahrokni and Reima Abobaker and Nataliia Borysenko,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104173,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"Elementary education, Robotics, Coding, Teacher learning, Computational thinking",,104173,,“It's a chance to make mistakes”: Processes and outcomes of coding in 2nd grade classrooms,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131521000506,168,2021,,
article,ARBELAEZOSSA2023102458,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has only partially (or not at all) been integrated into medical education, leading to growing concerns regarding how to train healthcare practitioners to handle the changes brought about by the introduction of AI. Programming lessons and other technical information into healthcare curricula has been proposed as a solution to support healthcare personnel in using AI or other future technology. However, integrating these core elements of computer science knowledge might not meet the observed need that students will benefit from gaining practical experience with AI in the direct application area. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic approach to case-based learning that utilizes the scenarios where AI is currently used in clinical practice as examples. This approach will support students' understanding of technical aspects. Case-based learning with AI as an example provides additional benefits: (1) it allows doctors to compare their thought processes to the AI suggestions and critically reflect on the assumptions and biases of AI and clinical practice; (2) it incentivizes doctors to discuss and address ethical issues inherent to technology and those already existing in current clinical practice; (3) it serves as a foundation for fostering interdisciplinary collaboration via discussion of different views between technologists, multidisciplinary experts, and healthcare professionals. The proposed knowledge shift from AI as a technical focus to AI as an example for case-based learning aims to encourage a different perspective on educational needs. Technical education does not need to compete with other essential clinical skills as it could serve as a basis for supporting them, which leads to better medical education and practice, ultimately benefiting patients.",,Laura {Arbelaez Ossa} and Michael Rost and Giorgia Lorenzini and David M.

The results show no statistically significant difference between female and male gaze and learning gain during the coding activity; interestingly, the qualitative data show differences in the strategies and implemented practices during coding, and in perceptions about those coding activities. Our results highlight that further studies need to utilize objective measures and unveil necessary differences in the design and implementation of coding activities.

The combination of innovative end-user development tools and standards-based curriculum that promotes IT fluency by shifting the pedagogical focus from programming to design, can address motivational aspects without sacrificing principled educational goals. The AgentCubes 3D game-authoring environment raises the ceiling of end-user development without raising the threshold.

article,RAPTI2024104968,"Critical thinking, Communication, Collaboration, and Creativity are regarded as key skills for today's learners. Interest in robotics usage to develop such competencies in educational settings arises but there hasn't been so far mapping of the research conducted in this field. Thus, we present a scoping review of 59 articles published from 2012 to 2023 in 4 Databases and 2 Registers examining kindergarteners' skills through Educational Robotics. Our goal was to map which skills are commonly examined in kindergarten and under which terminology as well as to investigate the studies' features, the types of robotics, and the assessment tools utilized. Our findings depict that several skills are evaluated using different terms. Critical thinking is examined most frequently, creativity the least, and communication is integrated into collaboration and the opposite. Most of the researchers used the mixed method focusing on qualitative tools, examining quite a small sample size, and conducting the intervention for a short time. Also: BeeBot, Lego robotics kits (WeDo, Mindstorms), and social, humanoid robots are often used. Additionally, the evaluation tools used in the reviewed papers are presented and categorized into groups. This scoping demonstrates that robotics might affect positively the children's cognitive skills and creativity but may not facilitate their interactions so much regarding emotional expressions. Moreover, a gap in quantitative research on kindergarteners' skills development via Educational Robotics is spotted. Finally, this scoping review suggests: creating clear terms for skills, developing robotics tailored to kindergarten age, forming full robotics activities, and designing modular evaluation tools for young learners' capacities.",,Sophia Rapti and Theodosios Sapounidis,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2023.104968,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"Educational robotics, Creativity, Critical thinking, Communication, Collaboration, Scoping review",,104968,,"“Critical thinking, Communication, Collaboration, Creativity in kindergarten with Educational Robotics”: A scoping review (2012–2023)",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131523002452,210,2024,,

article,FLANIGAN2017179,"This study investigated introductory computer science (CS1) students’ implicit beliefs of intelligence. Referencing Dweck and Leggett’s (1988) framework for implicit beliefs of intelligence, we examined how (1) students’ implicit beliefs changed over the course of a semester, (2) these changes differed as a function of course enrollment and students’ motivated self-regulated engagement profile, and (3) implicit beliefs predicted student learning based on standardized course grades and performance on a computational thinking knowledge test. For all students, there were significant increases in entity beliefs and significant decreases in incremental beliefs across the semester. However, examination of effect sizes suggests that significant findings for change across time were driven by changes in specific subpopulations of students. Moreover, results showed that students endorsed incremental belief more strongly than entity belief at both the beginning and end of the semester. Furthermore, the magnitude of changes differed based on students’ motivated self-regulated engagement profiles. Additionally, students’ achievement outcomes were weakly predicted by their implicit beliefs of intelligence.

article,KHANMOHAMMADI2024104660,"Education's evolution in the context of energy systems is essential for addressing sustainable energy challenges and developing a workforce equipped for future innovations, emphasizing both formal curricula and informal lifelong learning through successful energy case studies. As the global energy sector transforms to reduce carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, innovations in renewable technologies like solar thermal are pivotal for promoting energy security and economic stability, supported by an educational foundation that fosters awareness and technical skills for sustainable development. Exposure to successful renewable energy systems, such as solar-powered refrigeration, offers an informal educational experience that enhances understanding and supports global educational goals, initiating with the innovative design and optimization of these systems using artificial intelligence (neural networks). Based on this formulation, the current article developed two sustainable energy systems by comparing the refrigeration cycles with two different operating fluids and various arrangements, and multi-objective optimization with an evolutionary genetic algorithm is performed for the proposed systems. The studied systems are refrigeration cycles using an ejector and without an ejector with two working fluids of lithium bromide and lithium chloride. The present work's main aim is to examine the working fluid and refrigeration system arrangements. Energy and economic modeling were performed for the proposed systems, and then parametric analysis and two-objective optimization were extracted. Parameters such as generator temperature, condenser temperature, absorber temperature, and evaporator temperature, which significantly impact the proposed system's performance, have been selected as decision parameters, and parametric analysis has been extracted for them. In addition to the mentioned parameters, diffusion mixing efficiency, nozzle efficiency, and heat exchanger have also been studied in the ejector asset system. To find the best values of decision variables, multi-objective optimization for both arrangements is conducted, and results are presented. The results have indicated that the refrigeration system using lithium chloride working fluid without an ejector achieves a coefficient of performance of 0.766 and a cost of 0.922 $/h at the optimal point, while the system with an ejector yields a higher coefficient of performance (1.047) and a slightly lower cost rate (0.991 $/h). The outcomes of this work can play a critical role for higher education institutions in advancing innovative solutions to pressing energy challenges. Lifelong learning, at the heart of educational innovation, can benefit from the integration of sustainable energy systems as a core component of informal education through the optimization of ejector refrigeration systems.",,Shoaib Khanmohammadi and Pouria Ahmadi and Ali Jahangiri and Ali Izadi and Rasikh Tariq,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csite.2024.104660,,,,2214-157X,Case Studies in Thermal Engineering,"Genetic algorithm optimization, Artificial neural network, Ejector refrigeration systems, Lifelong learning, Educational innovation, Higher education, Computational thinking",,104660,,Comparative multi-objective optimization using neural networks for ejector refrigeration systems with LiBr and LiCl working agents,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214157X24006919,60,2024,,

This paper is aimed at a wide range of primary and secondary school teachers. With 1500 teachers who participated in the online training class for programming teachers as the object in Chinese primary, middle and high school stages, mainly from the three levels of schools, teachers, and students. The questionnaire with good reliability and validity test was used as the research method, the survey data were statistically described and analyzed, and differences were analyzed using Microsoft Excel2019, SPSS26.0 and so on, it investigates and analyzes the current situation of programming education in primary and secondary schools. Results indicate that the overall quality of programming education offerings in elementary and secondary schools is subpar, and the construction of programming education curriculum in schools requires improvement. Nevertheless, schools prioritize improving students' comprehensive abilities, and teachers hold a positive attitude towards programming education and teaching.

article,YU201917,"This paper presents a review of computational toys and kits that enable young children (ages 7 years old and under) to explore computational ideas and practices. We collected 30 computational kits, including 13 physical kits, 8 virtual kits, and 9 hybrid kits, and performed a qualitative analysis of these kits. We examined the kits across four different perspectives: how they are designed, how they support children to explore computational concepts and practices, how they enable children to engage in a range of projects and activities, and how they enable children to explore other domains of knowledge. Based on the analysis, we present design suggestions and opportunities to expand the possibilities in what computational ideas and other domains of knowledge children can explore, how children can engage in computing, and what kinds of projects children can make. While many kits enable the exploration of some computational concepts and practices, we see opportunities to expand how these concepts can be supported, as well as the new concepts and domains children could explore. We also see possibilities to include new modes of expression such as body motion or new media such as light and sound. Finally, we see possibilities for whom designers can better support, such as more explicit roles for adult caregivers and expanding possibilities for children from underrepresented groups in computing.

The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a tool to assess changes in young learners' attitudes toward coding: the Elementary Student Coding Attitudes Survey (ESCAS). We validated the scale using Confirmatory Factory Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling with responses from over 6000 4th-6th grade students (aged 9–12 years). Survey validation revealed a scale consisting of five constructs that comprise young learners' attitudes toward coding: social value, coding confidence, coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. In our analysis, students' grade level, ethnicity, gender, coding frequency, coding experience, and math interest influenced social value, which in turn influenced coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. Students' math confidence, coding frequency, coding experience, ethnicity, and coding interest predicted their coding confidence. Among observable variables, coding frequency and math interest had the greatest influence on social value, which substantially influenced all other factors.

article,MATTHEWS2021100278,"This paper investigates how children who are engaged in a creative project with tangible technology kits make sense of the system feedback the technology provides. A micro-analytic video study was conducted of primary school children designing their own technologies using existing educational microcontrollers. Our investigation reveals that the roles feedback plays in children’s interactions cannot easily be assimilated within the existing approaches to understand feedback that have been articulated in HCI literature. Our qualitative analysis shows how children do not make sense of feedback as semantic communication from the system, but make sense of it with respect to its embeddedness in a sequence of activities they are performing with the system and each other. The principal contribution to emerge from our study is a conception of feedback as a process, rather than as a semantic communicative event, nor a direct coupling of action and system response. Our discussion identifies how feedback participates in the institutional agendas of classrooms (e.g. discovery, computational thinking), and draws out initial implications for the design of feedback in educational tangible technologies, identifying possibilities for how feedback might be redesigned to better promote children’s diagnostic practices with open-ended technology kits.",,Sarah Matthews and Ben Matthews,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcci.2021.100278,,,,2212-8689,International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction,"Tangible technologies, Feedback, Educational technologies, Creative material, Interaction design, Empirical studies",,100278,,Reconceptualising feedback: Designing educational tangible technologies to be a creative material,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212868921000210,29,2021,,

Here, we report a study investigating elementary computing concepts through the lens of Embodied Cognition. Sixteen students (9 female) studying university-level computing were asked to explain their understanding of computing concepts (without materials) in individually video-recorded sessions. We analysed the gestures generated for three elementary concepts: algorithms, loops, and conditional statements. In total, 368 representational gestures were identified across 48 (16 × 3) explanations, thereby providing evidence that offline thinking in this domain is embodied. Our analysis of representational gestures showed that participants drew upon two overarching embodied metaphors in their explanations: 1) Computing Constructs as Physical Objects, in which participants simulated manipulating physical objects (e.g., pinching) when referring to range of computing constructs, and 2) Computing Processes as Motion along a Path, whereby participants moved their hands along one of three body-based axes when referring to temporal sequences.

The results were obtained from anonymous questionnaires completed by 221 course participants and their parents. The answers confirm that this type of course becomes a new fascinating manner of spending spare time by children. Moreover, quantitative analysis of student’s finals projects also has been performed. In the process of creative programming in the game-based environment, children develop the computational thinking skills, problem-solving strategies, and abstract thinking.

With the development of computer and Internet technology, gamified learning, as a new way of learning, combines the advantages of computer games and online learning, which not only meets the needs of people to learn anytime and anywhere, but also increases the fun of learning activities. In this paper, we developed a gamified learning software with traveler-type problems as the research content, through the interaction with the game, so that students can think in the game and learn knowledge through the game. Through the questionnaire for research and analysis, this game is good game fun and can stimulate learning interest well. In addition, this paper carries out an in-depth study of the game's help system, optimizes the algorithm for the help system, and proposes an improved genetic algorithm. The reverse learning method is adopted to improve the accuracy and convergence speed of the optimal solution; then the Metropolis criterion is used to improve the crossover and mutation operators to enhance the local search ability of the algorithm; finally, the concept of realistic elite learning is introduced to further enhance the local search ability of the algorithm.

article,AKINYEMI2022e01242,"ABSTRACT
Electron surface dissipation and quantum-limited size tend to control the material properties of exterior plasmon oscillation as the size of metal nanoparticles goes into the nanoscale domain. The need to examine this characteristic behaviour and its potential becomes imperative. This study explores the effects of the damping constant of electrons and size quantum-based frequency-dependent dielectric function (FDDF) of small metallic materials using an elementary model of electrons in a confined box. The frequency-dependent dielectric function is employed to study quantum size impacts and damping constant in the optical spectra region. The quantum amended frequency-dependent dielectric function and the absorbing spectra of silver-cube geometry for different sizes by adding damping constant and without damping constant are critically examined. The findings reveal that when the damping constant effect is absent, the multiple crests emerge for the quantum-amended frequency-dependent dielectric function and absorbing spectra of the metallic materials, highlighting the electronic discretization levels in the tiny quantum-limited structure. While the damping constant is included, the multiple summits are hidden and vanish owing to a considerable widening of the structures independently. The change in the numerical results from the quantum case to the classical case for growing widths is further illustrated for both cases. The numerical results enhance our knowledge of damping constant dissipation and quantum limited-size impact in small-scaled plasmonic devices.",,Lateef Akinyemi and Sunday Oladejo and Stephen Ekwe and Agbotiname Lucky Imoize and Stephen Abiodun Ojo,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2022.e01242,,,,2468-2276,Scientific African,"Damping constant, Frequency-dependent dielectric function (FDDF), Models, Surface Plasmon, Plasmonic devices",,e01242,,Effects of Damping Constant of Electron and Size on Quantum-Based Frequency-dependent Dielectric Function of Small Metallic Plasmonic Devices,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468227622001491,16,2022,,

article,KASONGO2023113,"In recent years, the spike in the amount of information transmitted through communication infrastructures has increased due to the advances in technologies such as cloud computing, vehicular networks systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), etc. As a result, attackers have multiplied their efforts for the purpose of rendering network systems vulnerable. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to improve the security of those network systems. In this study, an IDS framework using Machine Learning (ML) techniques is implemented. This framework uses different types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), namely, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Simple RNN. To assess the performance of the proposed IDS framework, the NSL-KDD and the UNSW-NB15 benchmark datasets are considered. Moreover, existing IDSs suffer from low test accuracy scores in detecting new attacks as the feature dimension grows. In this study, an XGBoost-based feature selection algorithm was implemented to reduce the feature space of each dataset. Following that process, 17 and 22 relevant attributes were picked from the UNSW-NB15 and NSL-KDD, respectively. The accuracy obtained through the test subsets was used as the main performance metric in conjunction with the F1-Score, the validation accuracy, and the training time (in seconds). The results showed that for the binary classification tasks using the NSL-KDD, the XGBoost-LSTM achieved the best performance with a test accuracy (TAC) of 88.13%, a validation accuracy (VAC) of 99.49% and a training time of 225.46 s. For the UNSW-NB15, the XGBoost-Simple-RNN was the most efficient model with a TAC of 87.07%. For the multiclass classification scheme, the XGBoost-LSTM achieved a TAC of 86.93% over the NSL-KDD and the XGBoost-GRU obtained a TAC of 78.40% over the UNSW-NB15 dataset.

article,KIM202348,"Purpose
Self-report of sensitive or stigmatized health states is often subject to social desirability and interviewer biases. To reduce such biases, we estimated the rate of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) using a list experiment.
Methods
This population-representative study was nested within the Dar es Salaam Urban Cohort Study, a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in the Ukonga ward of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Men and women aged ≥40years were randomly assigned to receive a list of either four control items (i.e., the control group) or four control items plus an additional item on having had a disease through sexual contacts in the past 12months (i.e., the treatment group). We calculated the mean difference in the total number of items to which respondents answered “yes” in the treatment versus control group and compared this prevalence estimate to the one measured by the direct question.
Results
A total of 2310 adults aged ≥40years were enrolled in the study: 32% were male and 48% were aged 40–49years. The estimated prevalence of having STIs in the past 12months was 17.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.3–23.3) in the list experiment, almost 10 times higher than the estimated prevalence of 1.8% (95%CI 1.3–2.4) based on the direct question (P < .001). STI prevalence remained high after adjusting for age, the number of lifetime sex partners, alcohol consumption and smoking in multivariate linear regression (15.6%; 95% CI 7.3–23.9).
Conclusions
We found a substantially higher prevalence of STIs among older adults in urban Tanzania when we based our estimation on a list experiment rather than a direct question in a population-representative survey. List experiments should be considered to elimnate social desirability and interviewer biases in surveys of sensitive or stigmatized health states. The very high prevalence of STIs highlights the need for improved access to STI screening, prevention and treatment for older adults in urban Africa.",,Hae-Young Kim and Julia Rohr and Germana Henry Leyna and Japhet Killewo and Andrew Tomita and Frank Tanser and Till Bärnighausen,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2023.05.001,,,,1047-2797,Annals of Epidemiology,"List experiment, Sexually transmitted diseases, Prevalence, Older adults, Tanzania",,48-53,,High prevalence of self-reported sexually transmitted infections among older adults in Tanzania: results from a list experiment in a population-representative survey,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047279723000868,84,2023,,

article,BRIAN2023129074,"We introduce mindset streams for assessing ways of bridging two target concepts in concept maps. We focus on behavioural forma mentis networks (BFMN), which map the associative and affective dimensions of memory recalls. Inspired by trains of thoughts taking several paths to link ideas, mindset streams are defined as BFMN subgraphs induced by all shortest paths between two target concepts, e.g. all recalls in shortest paths bridging “math” and “learning”. These streams quantify the following features of the mindset encoded in a BFMN: (i) semantic content (i.e. which ideas mediate connections between targets?), (ii) valence coherence/conflict (i.e. are connections mediated by entwining ideas perceived negatively, positively or neutrally?), and (iii) semantic relevance (i.e. are the bridges between targets peripheral or central for the connectivity/betweenness of the BFMN?). We investigate mindset streams between ‘maths”/“physics” and key motivational aspects of learning (“fun”, “work”, “failure”) in two BFMNs, encoding how 159 students and 59 experts perceived and associated concepts about Science Technology Engineering and Maths (STEM), respectively. Statistical comparisons against configuration models show that high schoolers bridge “maths” and “fun” only through overabundant levels of valence-conflicting associations, contrasting negatively perceived domain knowledge with peer-related positive experiences. This conflict is absent in the researchers’ mindset stream, which rather bridges “math” and “fun” through positive, science-related associations. The mindset streams of both groups bridge “maths” and “physics” to “work” through mostly positive career-related jargon. Students’ mindset streams of “failure” and “math”/“physics” are dominated by negative associations with test anxiety, whereas researchers integrate “failure” and “math”/“physics” in semantically richer and more positive contexts, denoting failure itself as a cornerstone of STEM learning.

article,BROLL2018189,The paper introduces a visual programming language and corresponding web and cloud-based development environment called NetsBlox. NetsBlox is an extension of Snap! and builds upon its visual formalism as well as its open source code base. NetsBlox adds distributed programming capabilities by introducing two well-known abstractions to block-based programming: message passing and Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). Messages containing data can be exchanged by two or more NetsBlox programs running on different computers connected to the Internet. RPCs are called on a client program and are executed on the NetsBlox server. These two abstractions make it possible to create distributed programs such as multi-player games or client–server applications. We believe that NetsBlox not only teaches basic distributed programming concepts but also provides increased motivation for high-school students to become creators and not just consumers of technology.,,Brian Broll and Ákos Lédeczi and Hamid Zare and Dung Nguyen Do and János Sallai and Péter Völgyesi and Miklós Maróti and Lesa Brown and Chris Vanags,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2018.02.021,,,,0743-7315,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,"Visual programming, Distributed programming, Computer science education",,189-200,,A visual programming environment for introducing distributed computing to secondary education,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743731518300996,118,2018,,
article,OTTENBREITLEFTWICH2021100057,"Many stakeholders have suggested that if girls are not engaged in computer science at an early age, the field of computer science (CS) (and computing-related fields) will continue to lack gender diversity. We need more explorations of how curriculum impacts girls’ interest in computer science at the elementary level. The focus of this research project was to examine how an elementary problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum impacted girls’ understanding of and interest in CS. By utilizing a curriculum focused on a problem that emphasized social activism, we hypothesized that PBL CS could increase interest in CS for girls. This study used a mixed-method sequential explanatory research design to examine the implementation of a CS PBL curriculum with four 6th grade teachers and their 263 students. We collected student CS knowledge pre-tests and post-tests, student attitude surveys, student focus group interviews, teacher interviews, and researcher observation reflection notes. The knowledge tests were analyzed using a mixed measures ANOVA. The survey responses were analyzed using ANOVAs and effect sizes for each comparison were calculated using partial eta squared. The qualitative data was analyzed using a thematic approach that required four researchers to come to a consensus. Results suggested that although girls had less understanding of CS at the beginning, by the end of the curriculum, girls and boys performed similarly. However, there were still elements that were not successful. Girls’ attitudes towards computer science were significantly lower than the boys at the end of the curriculum. Conceptually, the curriculum needs to specifically address how CS could impact values held by girls.",,Anne T. Ottenbreit-Leftwich and Kyungbin Kwon and Thomas A.

Although this observation is generally made from the teacher's perspective, neuroscience can provide new insights by establishing the neurobiological underpinning of social interactions. This paper further develops this line of research by utilizing graph theory to represent interactions between teachers and students at the neural level. Through hyperscanning with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we collected data from the prefrontal cortex and the temporoparietal junction of 24 dyads composed of a teacher and a student. Each dyad used a board game to perform a programming logic class that consisted of three steps: independent activities (control), presentation of concepts, and interactive exercises. Graph theory provides results regarding the strength of teacher–student interaction and the main channels involved in these interactions. We combined graph modularity and bootstrap to measure pair coactivation, thus establishing the strength of teacher–student interaction. Also, graph centrality detects the main brain channels involved during this interaction.

To maintain and improve students' learning motivation and interest, and more effectively carry out personalized teaching capabilities, research focuses on students' personalized knowledge structure. Starting from tracking the differences in knowledge structures among different learners, a game model based on entrepreneurial education theory has been designed. Through modeling learner knowledge using Bayesian network, the research constructs a game framework of entrepreneurial education for adaptive learning. On this basis, a new feature crossover method is proposed to construct a deep knowledge tracking model based on feature embedding and attention mechanism. It was combined with adaptive learning technology to ultimately construct an entrepreneurial education game model that integrates adaptive learning and improved deep knowledge tracking.

We had three research questions focused on children's game play: 1) How does the structure of each game influence children's play? 2) Do children play more or less independently depending on the game they play? 3) Do children who play the games more independently learn more coding skills? Three researchers coded more than 6 h of video data showing children's play with digital coding games. Findings include, that the type of game did influence the different ways that children behaved while playing. However, during both games, children had the same amount of independent play. Children who played more independently during Daisy the Dinosaur learned more coding skills. This may be because these children were focusing more on the game than their peers as we did not find a similar effect for the game Kodable.

article,OLADEJO2024111880,"In this paper, a novel metaheuristic called ‘The Hiking Optimization Algorithm’ (HOA) is proposed. HOA is inspired by hiking, a popular recreational activity, in recognition of the similarity between the search landscapes of optimization problems and the mountainous terrains traversed by hikers. HOA’s mathematical model is premised on Tobler’s Hiking Function (THF), which determines the walking velocity of hikers (i.e. agents) by considering the elevation of the terrain and the distance covered. THF is employed in determining hikers’ positions in the course of solving an optimization problem. HOA’s performance is demonstrated by benchmarking with 29 well-known test functions (including unimodal, multimodal, fixed-dimension multimodal, and composite functions), three engineering design problems (EDPs), (including I-beam, tension/compression spring, and gear train problems) and two N-P Hard problems (i.e. Traveling Salesman’s and Knapsack Problems). Moreover, HOA’s results are verified by comparison to 14 other metaheuristics, including Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm Optimization, Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) as well as newly introduced algorithms such as Komodo Mlipir Algorithm (KMA), Quadratic Interpolation Optimization (QIO), and Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm (COVIDOA). In this study, we employ statistical tests such as the Wilcoxon rank sum, Friedman test, and Dunn’s post hoc test for the performance evaluation.

article,HUGHESROBERTS2020103988,"Digital game making is becoming an increasingly common means of learning in schools due to the appeal of delivering curriculum-based learning objectives while tapping into the popularity of videogames. Indeed, research suggests that digital game making may improve cognitive and behavioral skills in learners and this may have significant impact on learners with special education needs and disabilities (SEND). However, past work in digital game making has limited involvement with learners with SEND, focuses on short-term evaluations and is utilised during extra-curricular sessions with few studies using an action-based field research approach. Furthermore, there is little quantitative data from defined methodologies that demonstrate the impact of digital game-making on learning. This paper presents results from two field trials examining the use of digital game making in two schools (one mixed ability primary and one special school) to deliver national curriculum-based content over 8-weeks. Results from a feasibility trial informed a pedagogical design and identified evaluation metrics for a subsequent longer trial. Evaluation metrics included learner engagement and collaboration with peers as suitable indicators of inclusive learning. Impact on these metrics was measured using an in-class observation tool that sampled learner behavior yielding quantitative data and follow up interviews with teachers yielding qualitative data. Results suggest that digital game making is at least as effective in encouraging engagement and collaboration in learners when compared to traditional methods, with it being more engaging for learners with special needs.

article,TAO2023100116,"Online learning and teaching increased in 2020, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. As many researchers attempted to understand the impact stress had on the emotional behaviours and academic performance of students, most studies explored these pre- and during-COVID behaviours in the context of brick and mortar institutions transitioning to online delivery. There is an opportunity to compare the experiences of students in the MOOC environment in this period, particularly in terms of the difference of engagement, semantics and sentiment/stress behaviours in 2019 and 2020. In this study, we use a dataset from AdelaideX between this time period to identify the most significant features that impact student outcomes. Where previous machine learning approaches used singular features such as student interaction or sentiment in discussion forum posts, we incorporate three feature categories of engagement, semantics and sentiment/stress in an ensemble model is based on voting and stacked methods to determining the relationship between them and academic performance.

article,VERDUZCO2022103189,"It is presented the development and implementation of a new computed aided learning MatLab Toolbox for the design of reinforced concrete structures named as CALRECOD for their abbreviation Computer Aided Learning of Reinforced Concrete Design. Such development emerges as the result of a series of research works in the Autonomous University of Queretaro with the main purpose of improving the way in which the design of reinforced concrete structures is taught in high education institutions. CALRECOD uses optimization methods and algorithms to aid students in their design interaction learning so that they are able to compare their own designs and what commercial software delivers with optimal ones given certain load conditions on the elements or structures. The software consists almost entirely of MatLab functions (.m files) and the ACI 318-19 code is taken as their main design reference to make it internationally useful, although in some cases the Mexican code NTC-17 specifications are used. Besides MatLab functions, the software consists as well of ANSYS SpaceClaim script functions (.scscript files) as an additional tool for the aid in the visualization of design results in a 3D space in the software ANSYS SpaceClaim. CALRECOD has proven to be versatile, flexible and of easy use with a huge potential to increase learning outcomes for students in high education programs related with the design of reinforced concrete structures as well as to enhance the creation of efficient interactive environments for researchers and academics focused on the development of new design and analysis methods for such structures. With their optimization design functions, a solid comparison platform of designs’ performance could be laid out, and with its extended function design packages for structural systems, reinforced concrete design courses could be enhanced in a great deal regarding their program content’s scope.

article,CELLA2024107262,"Background
Italy was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, experiencing multiple waves of infection following the sequential emergence of new variants. Understanding the transmission patterns and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is vital for future preparedness.
Methods
We conducted an analysis of viral genome sequences, integrating epidemiological and phylodynamic approaches, to characterize how SARS-CoV-2 variants have spread within the country.
Results
Our findings indicate bidirectional international transmission, with Italy transitioning between importing and exporting the virus. Italy experienced four distinct epidemic waves, each associated with a significant reduction in fatalities from 2021 to 2023. These waves were primarily driven by the emergence of VOCs such as Alpha, Delta, and Omicron, which were reflected in observed transmission dynamics and effectiveness of public health measures.
Conclusions
The changing patterns of viral spread and variant prevalence throughout Italy's pandemic response underscore the continued importance of flexible public health strategies and genomic surveillance, both of which are crucial for tracking the evolution of variants and adapting control measures effectively to ensure preparedness for future outbreaks.",,Eleonora Cella and Vagner Fonseca and Francesco Branda and Stephane Tosta and Keldenn Moreno and Gabriel Schuab and Sobur Ali and Svetoslav Nanev Slavov and Fabio Scarpa and Luciane Amorim Santos and Simone Kashima and Eduan Wilkinson and Houriiyah Tegally and Carla Mavian and Alessandra Borsetti and Francesca Caccuri and Marco Salemi and Tulio {de Oliveira} and Taj Azarian and Ana Maria Bispo {de Filippis} and Luiz Carlos Junior Alcantara and Giancarlo Ceccarelli and Arnaldo Caruso and Vittorio Colizzi and Alessandro Marcello and José Lourenço and Massimo Ciccozzi and Marta Giovanetti,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2024.107262,,,,1201-9712,International Journal of Infectious Diseases,"SARS-CoV-2, D614G variant, Italy, pandemic, genomic epidemiology",,107262,,"Integrated analyses of the transmission history of SARS-CoV-2 and its association with molecular evolution of the virus underlining the pandemic outbreaks in Italy, 2019-2023",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971224003333,,2024,,

The challenges facing 21st-century society are becoming increasingly complex, requiring the development of new citizen competencies. This study aims to validate an educational model focused on developing complex thinking in higher education students. Current educational models lack future-ready competencies, necessitating the emergence of new models to guide future generations toward the common good.
Design/methodology/approach
This was an adaptation of the causal-layered analysis (CLA) applied to 415 participants from higher education institutions in Mexico, Panama and Spain. Sessions were designed to present the proposed educational model and explore participants’ perceptions of its significance and contributions to future education.
Findings
Key findings include the following: participants perceived complexity as difficult and challenging; causes of problems were linked to outdated educational models requiring replacement by those that develop students’ competencies; participants envisioned changes that would develop individuals capable of understanding and transforming society; and participants recognized the model’s transformative potential, offering a novel proposal for 21st-century education.

article,XU2024101574,"In the 21st century, the requirements for talent abilities are becoming increasingly diversified. Traditional skill learning methods cannot meet this demand, while complex learning can adapt to this demand for talent. In complex learning systems, various factors such as instructional theory, instructional interventions, and technology work together to facilitate the acquisition of complex thinking or operational skills. However, the effectiveness of instructional factors in complex skills learning remains unknown. To find out the effects of these factors on the acquisition of different complex skills, this meta-analysis includes 60 empirical studies and the effectiveness of 4C/ID model, instructional interventions and technical support on different complex learning are investigated. Complex skills learning had a moderate positive overall effect in acquiring complex skills: g = 0.67, 95% CI [0.49, 0.85]. Both thinking skills (g = 0.69, 95% CI [0.44, 0.94], k = 40) and operational skills (g = 0.64, 95% CI [0.38, 0.89], k = 20) showed moderate positive effects, and there was small but not statistically significant difference in the effect sizes between the two groups. Funnel plot, Egger's test and Rank Correlation Test results show that the findings were likely not to be affected by publication bias. We conclude that: compared to traditional learning, (1) the 4C/ID model is more suitable for thinking skills learning and has a significant large positive promotion effect. (2) Different instructional interventions can play a positive role in promoting the learning of complex skills. Learning scaffolding and learning platforms and tools are more suitable for operational skills learning, while thinking skills learning can benefit more from the adjustment of instructional models. (3) A variety of technologies can have a high effect on facilitating complex thinking and operational skills. These results show that different instructional interventions and technical support play a vital role in the learning of complex skills.

article,MOODLEY2022e1855,"Summary
Data sharing in research is fraught with controversy. Academic success is premised on competitive advantage, with research teams protecting their research findings until publication. Research funders, by contrast, often require data sharing. Beyond traditional research and funding requirements, surveillance data have become contentious. Public health emergencies involving pathogens require intense genomic surveillance efforts and call for the rapid sharing of data on the basis of public interest. Under these circumstances, timely sharing of data becomes a matter of scientific integrity. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the transformative potential of genomic pathogen data sharing became obvious and advanced the debate on data sharing. However, when the genomic sequencing data of the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant was shared and announced by scientists in southern Africa, various challenges arose, including travel bans. The scientific, economic, and moral impact was catastrophic. Yet, travel restrictions failed to mitigate the spread of the variant already present in countries outside Africa. Public perceptions of the negative effect of data sharing are detrimental to the willingness of research participants to consent to sharing data in postpandemic research and future pandemics.

In this document we describe the development of a remote lab and two user interfaces for teaching programming and fundamentals of robotics using Arduino boards. One of the interfaces uses visual language to make the experience more attractive for those who are beginning their studies. The second interface provides an environment similar to the original Arduino’s one for those users who have some background to use textual programming language. In addition, we present an usability evaluation of the application using visual programming language to obtain a broad feedback mainly in terms of target audience’s acceptance and suggestions for improvements.

article,GIOVANETTI2022,"Despite the considerable morbidity and mortality of arboviral infections in Brazil, such as Zika, chikungunya, dengue fever, and yellow fever, our understanding of these outbreaks is hampered by the limited availability of genomic data to track and control the epidemic. In this study, we provide a retrospective reconstruction of the Zika virus transmission dynamics in the state of Goiás by analyzing genomic data from areas in Midwest Brazil not covered by other previous studies.
ABSTRACT
Since the introduction of the Zika virus (ZIKV) into Brazil in 2015, its transmission dynamics have been intensively studied in many parts of the country, although much is still unknown about its circulation in the midwestern states. Here, using nanopore technology, we obtained 23 novel partial and near-complete ZIKV genomes from the state of Goiás, located in the Midwest of Brazil. Genomic, phylogenetic, and epidemiological approaches were used to retrospectively explore the spatiotemporal evolution of the ZIKV-Asian genotype in this region. As a likely consequence of a gradual accumulation of herd immunity, epidemiological data revealed a decline in the number of reported cases over 2018 to 2021. Phylogenetic reconstructions revealed that multiple independent introductions of the Asian lineage have occurred in Goiás over time and revealed a complex transmission dynamic between epidemic seasons. Together, our results highlight the utility of genomic, epidemiological, and evolutionary methods to understand mosquito-borne epidemics.
IMPORTANCE Despite the considerable morbidity and mortality of arboviral infections in Brazil, such as Zika, chikungunya, dengue fever, and yellow fever, our understanding of these outbreaks is hampered by the limited availability of genomic data to track and control the epidemic. In this study, we provide a retrospective reconstruction of the Zika virus transmission dynamics in the state of Goiás by analyzing genomic data from areas in Midwest Brazil not covered by other previous studies. Our study provides an understanding of how ZIKV initiates transmission in this region and reveals a complex transmission dynamic between epidemic seasons. Together, our results highlight the utility of genomic, epidemiological, and evolutionary methods to understand mosquito-borne epidemics, revealing how this toolkit can be used to help policymakers prioritize areas to be targeted, especially in the context of finite public health resources.",,Marta Giovanetti and Luiz Augusto Pereira and Talita Émile Ribeiro Adelino and Vagner Fonseca and Joilson Xavier and Allison {de Araújo Fabri} and Svetoslav Nanev Slavov and Poliana {da Silva Lemos} and William {de Almeida Marques} and Simone Kashima and José Lourenço and Tulio {de Oliveira} and Carlos Frederico {Campelo de Albuquerque} and Carla Freitas and Cassio Roberto Leonel Peterka and Rivaldo Venancio {da Cunha} and Ana Flávia Mendonça and Vinícius {Lemes da Silva} and Luiz Carlos Junior Alcantara and Tino Polen,,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00155-22,,,,2165-0497,Microbiology Spectrum,"Zika virus, Asian lineage, Midwest Brazil, genomic epidemiology",2.0,,,A Retrospective Overview of Zika Virus Evolution in the Midwest of Brazil,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2165049722002062,10,2022,,
article,KONG2021104267,"Programming is perceived to be an indispensable type of literacy in the digital era. To effectively promote and implement programming in K–12 education, it is necessary to understand school principals' perception of programming education. This study adopted a mixed methods design to explain principals’ understanding, expectations, and support for programming education in primary schools using Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). In study 1, survey questionnaires were distributed to all principals from public primary schools in Hong Kong. Two hundred and sixty-six principals responded to the survey (response rate = 55.6%). In study 2, a follow-up interview study with 13 principals was conducted to further explore their perception of programming education. The results of study 1 indicated that principals with a better understanding of programming education tend to have clearer expectations of how to implement programming education in their schools, which consequently leads to greater support for the implementation of programming education. In study 2, the thematic analysis further supported the results obtained in study 1. Specifically, the results of study 2 demonstrated that most principals show understanding, expectation, and support for the implementation of programming education, which in turn results in various positive student and teacher outcomes. The results also showed that challenges are inevitable during implementation, principals show capabilities and willingness to adjust their expectation and support to better integrate programming education into their school curricula.",,Siu-Cheung Kong and Yi-Qing Wang,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104267,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"Mixed methods design, Pedagogical issues, Primary school, Programming education, Theory of reasoned action",,104267,,Investigating primary school principals’ programming perception and support from the perspective of reasoned action: A mixed methods approach,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131521001445,172,2021,,

Still, children are often not included in this discussion, while there is much to learn from current uses and children's understandings of AI and robotics. The study is based on a seven-month ethnographical work that details the implementation of a robot in two preschool groups of children aged 1–2 and 3–5 (n = 38). The study descriptively combines a framework for children's play analysis with explorative qualitative child interviews (n = 6) with the 3-5-year-olds to examine how children play with the robot and their thinking about a future with robots and AI. The results show how children's play with robots spans all of Hughes's (2011) sixteen play types and integrates robots into play in ways specific to child-robot interaction. The interviews indicate that children have well-formed knowledge about the current uses of robots and AI and elaborate imaginaries about a future with them, including critical boundaries toward robots and AI agents.

article,HOWLAND2015224,"Teaching basic computational concepts and skills to school children is currently a curricular focus in many countries. Running parallel to this trend are advances in programming environments and teaching methods which aim to make computer science more accessible, and more motivating. In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of Flip, a programming language that aims to help 11–15 year olds develop computational skills through creating their own 3D role-playing games. Flip has two main components: 1) a visual language (based on an interlocking blocks design common to many current visual languages), and 2) a dynamically updating natural language version of the script under creation. This programming-language/natural-language pairing is a unique feature of Flip, designed to allow learners to draw upon their familiarity with natural language to “decode the code”. Flip aims to support young people in developing an understanding of computational concepts as well as the skills to use and communicate these concepts effectively. This paper investigates the extent to which Flip can be used by young people to create working scripts, and examines improvements in their expression of computational rules and concepts after using the tool. We provide an overview of the design and implementation of Flip before describing an evaluation study carried out with 12–13 year olds in a naturalistic setting. Over the course of 8 weeks, the majority of students were able to use Flip to write small programs to bring about interactive behaviours in the games they created. Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in their computational communication after using Flip (as measured by a pre/post-test). An additional finding was that girls wrote more, and more complex, scripts than did boys, and there was a trend for girls to show greater learning gains relative to the boys.",,Kate Howland and Judith Good,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2014.08.014,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"Evaluation of CAL systems, Interactive learning environments, Programming and programming languages, Secondary education",,224-240,,Learning to communicate computationally with Flip: A bi-modal programming language for game creation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013151400195X,80,2015,,
article,MISHRA2024108508,"Information and communication technologies play a significant role in all aspects of modern society. It has become a subject of high significance in all perspectives, mainly in the workstation. Consequently, the main objective for universities and schools is to develop future specialists for handling the problems and finding the effective outcomes by their digital competency as a significant ability. In higher education institutions, assessing the key drivers of digital transformation is a complicated decision-making problem as the multiple factors are involved in it. To this aim, a novel picture fuzzy information-based decision-making framework is proposed to assess the key drivers of digital transformation in higher education institutions. In this regard, an improved score function is proposed to rank the picture fuzzy numbers. In addition, it is used to determine the weights of decision experts. Next, some generalized Dombi aggregation operators are proposed to aggregate the picture fuzzy information. Further, an integrated criteria weighting model is presented based on the combination of objective weights through standard deviation-based model and subjective weights through pivot pairwise relative criteria importance assessment (PIPRECIA) model in the context of picture fuzzy sets. To rank the alternatives, a picture fuzzy extension of alternative ranking order model accounting for two step normalization (AROMAN) approach is proposed using the score function, Dombi operators and integrated weighting model. The usefulness of the proposed approach is illustrated using a case study of key drivers' assessment of digital transformation in higher education institutions. Sensitivity and comparative analyses are discussed to reveal the consistency, robustness and efficiency of introduced model.

incollection,ADAMS2024593,"Quantum biology is, most simply, the investigation of quantum effects in biological systems. While all matter is fundamentally quantum, quantum biology focuses on those quantum effects that result in properties of biological scale and relevance. It has long been argued that quantum effects are incompatible with biological systems, due to the likelihood of decoherence. But nature is a surprising and enterprising engineer. In this sense, quantum biology is the study of nature's materials and how they might sustain and enhance quantum effects, even in hot and wet environments. Quantum mechanics was developed in response to seemingly anomalous interactions between light and matter. It seems fitting that a great deal of the progress made in quantum biology in the last few decades has been on the topic of photosynthesis: the interaction of light with living matter. The interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter is also at the heart of many other topics of quantum biology. This review is a broad overview of the current state of this research. While the underlying quantum effects are often similar—energy and charge transfer, tunnelling, spin dynamics—the biological contexts are varied and continue to grow. These contexts include enzyme catalysis, DNA mutation, receptor binding, photosynthesis, microtubule and mitochondrial function, magnetoreception, regulation of the production of reactive oxygen species, calcium ion storage and release and, potentially, consciousness. While there remain a number of reservations regarding quantum biology, progress made in this regard might further our understanding of both quantum and biological systems. With respect to the latter, advances in understanding biology might also contribute to a better understanding of physiology and the development of new therapeutics.

They performed a Go/No-go task (inhibition), a Corsi blocks backward task (working memory), a flexible item selection task (cognitive flexibility), and three science problem-solving tasks, including two gear turning tasks and one stabilization task. Structural equation modeling showed that working memory and cognitive flexibility individually contributed to problem-solving performance, whereas inhibition did not.

article,CHENG2019361,"There has recently been a renewed interest in integrating programming into the curriculum of primary education, partly due to the availability of the visual programming environment (VPE) designed for educational purposes. While substantial progress on exploring the potential benefits of VPE has been achieved, much remains to be done to understand students' acceptance of VPE and whether gender difference plays a role in their acceptance. This study was thus designed to extend the technology acceptance model to identify determinants influencing boys' and girls' behavioural intention to use VPE in the primary school context. It used a mixed method approach to evaluate the proposed model using questionnaire and interview data collected from 431 students (296 boys and 135 girls) in 38 primary schools. Among boys and girls, computer self-efficacy is shown to be the external factor significantly influencing both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of VPE, while attitude towards VPE is found to have a significant effect on behavioural intention to use VPE. In addition, gender differences are found in the impact of social influence and external encouragement on students' perceptions towards VPE, and also in the impact of students' perceptions towards VPE on their behavioural intention to use it.

article,WU2024100295,"There is growing recognition among researchers and stakeholders about the significant impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technology on classroom instruction. As a crucial element in developing AI literacy, AI education in K-12 schools is increasingly gaining attention. However, most existing research on K-12 AI education relies on experiential methodologies and suffers from a lack of quantitative analysis based on extensive classroom data, hindering a comprehensive depiction of AI education's current state at these educational levels. To address this gap, this article employs the advanced semantic understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to create an intelligent analysis framework that identifies learning theories, pedagogical approaches, learning tools, and levels of AI literacy in AI classroom instruction. Compared with the results of manual analysis, analysis based on LLMs can achieve more than 90% consistency. Our findings, based on the analysis of 98 classroom instruction videos in central Chinese cities, reveal that current AI classroom instruction insufficiently foster AI literacy, with only 35.71% addressing higher-level skills such as evaluating and creating AI. AI ethics are even less commonly addressed, featured in just 5.1% of classroom instruction. We classified AI classroom instruction into three categories: conceptual (50%), heuristic (18.37%), and experimental (31.63%). Correlation analysis suggests a significant relationship between the adoption of pedagogical approaches and the development of advanced AI literacy.

One of these areas is programming learning and program writing processes. One of the generative AI tools used for this purpose is ChatGPT. The use of ChatGPT in program writing processes has become widespread, and this tool has a certain potential in the programming process. However, when the literature is examined, research results related to using ChatGPT for this purpose have yet to be found. The existing literature has a gap that requires exploration. This study aims to analyze the students' perspectives on using ChatGPT in the field of programming and programming learning. The study encompassed a cohort of 41 undergraduate students enrolled in a public university's Computer Technology and Information Systems department. The research was carried out within the scope of the Object-Oriented Programming II course for eight weeks. Throughout the research process, students were given project assignments related to the course every week, and they were asked to use ChatGPT while solving them. The research data was collected using a form consisting of open-ended questions and analyzed through content analysis. The research findings revealed both the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT usage, as perceived by the students. The students stated that the main benefits of using ChatGPT in programming learning are providing fast and mostly correct answers to questions, improving thinking skills, facilitating debugging, and increasing self-confidence. On the other hand, the main limitations of using ChatGPT in programming education were getting students used to laziness, being unable to answer some questions, or giving incomplete/incorrect answers, causing professional anxiety in students. Based on the results of the research, it can be said that it would be useful to integrate generative AI tools into programming courses considering the advantages they provide in programming teaching.

In this study, we investigated the effect of collaborative perception on cognitive engagement and learning outcomes in collaborative programming. We used a quasi-experimental research to determine the differences in cognitive engagement and learning outcomes of three groups with different levels of collaborative perception. The findings highlight several important conclusions. First, there were significant differences in cognitive engagement and learning outcomes across collaborative perception groups. Students with high levels of collaborative perception demonstrate more comprehensive and diverse cognitive engagement, resulting in higher learning outcomes compared to those with lower perception. Second, students in the low collaborative perception group had more Clarification-Elaboration cognitive connections, and students in the high collaborative perception group had stronger Clarification-Positioning and Clarification-Verification cognitive connections. Third, collaborative perception positively moderated the relationship between cognitive engagement and learning outcomes. In particular, three cognitive engagement, Clarification, Elaboration, and Positioning, had a greater impact on performance when moderated by collaborative perceptions.

Concerns around accuracy and performance of rapid antigen tests continue to be raised with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Objective
To evaluate the performance of two widely used SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests during BA.4/BA.5 SARS-CoV-2 wave in South Africa (May – June 2022).
Study design
A prospective field evaluation compared the SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid test from Hangzhou AllTest Biotech (nasal swab) and the Standard Q COVID-19 Rapid Antigen test from SD Biosensor (nasopharyngeal swab) to the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay (nasopharyngeal swab) on samples collected from 540 study participants.
Results
Overall 28.52% (154/540) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive with median cycle number value of 12.30 (IQR 9.30–19.40). Out of the 99 successfully sequenced SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, 18 were classified as BA.4 and 56 were classified as BA.5.

article,CHENG2023100171,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a transformative force across diverse sectors worldwide, with policy initiatives signalling its rising prominence. In the realm of education, AI holds promise for revolutionising learning and teaching. However, the incorporation of AI in basic education faces significant challenges for many schools, particularly when explicit curriculum guidelines are absent, and teachers have limited exposure to AI technologies. This study delves into the importance of integrating Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), particularly in primary and secondary school settings, with a specific emphasis on the obstacles and facilitators. The research examines the impact of digital leadership and its role in mitigating teachers' barriers to AIED incorporations. These external variables are systematically outlined within the conceptual framework proposed by this study. Furthermore, it conceptualises and considers three AIED approaches—Learning from AI, Learning about AI, and Learning with AI—as internal variables central to basic-education AIED incorporations, as highlighted in previous research. The study gathers quantitative data through a self-constructed questionnaire survey from 204 school principals and management-level teachers across 60 primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong, capturing their perceptions of AIED incorporation. A structural equation model (SEM) is adopted to analyse the relationships between digital leadership, internal and external teacher barriers, and the three AIED approaches. The findings underscore that digital leadership is a significant factor in facilitating AI incorporations in schools, and that teachers' internal and external barriers considerably affect Learning about AI.

article,GILES20221,"Background
Snakebite victims are commonly seen in KwaZulu-Natal Hospitals, with only a minority of patients requiring antivenom. This study reviewed antivenom-associated adverse events at our institution, after administration of the South African Vaccine Producers (SAVP) polyvalent antivenom.
Methods
A retrospective review, over 52 months (January 2016–April 2020), of patients who received antivenom. Demographics, clinical details and clinical course following antivenom administration were analysed.
Results
Emergency department doctors treated 758 snakebites; 156 patients were admitted of which 51 (33%) received antivenom. Indications for antivenom included: neurotoxicity (24%), haemotoxicity (18%) and significant cytotoxicity (58%). Antivenom-associated adverse events occurred in 61% of patients; with 47% developing anaphylaxis requiring adrenaline infusion. There was a higher incidence of anaphylaxis in children (57%) than in adults (40%), p = 0.55. There was no association between antivenom dose and anaphylaxis. No benefit was noted with adrenaline premedication (p = 0.64), nor with the addition of antihistamine or steroid pre-medicants to adrenaline (p = 0.61). Multivariable logistic regression identified age as a predictor for anaphylaxis, but not dose or duration of antivenom and not any particular form of premedication. Intubation was required in 29% of patients developing anaphylaxis. There were no deaths and all patients made full recovery.
Conclusion
Almost half of the patients at Ngwelezana hospital in Kwazulu-Natal receiving the SAVP polyvalent antivenom developed anaphylaxis requiring adrenaline infusion, with children at higher risk. The administration of this antivenom must only be given for valid indications, in a high-care environment by medical personnel ready to manage anaphylactic shock.

article,WOLFENGAGEN20229,"Computational activity is now recognized as a natural science, and computational and information processes have been discovered in the deep structures of many areas. Computations in the natural world were present long before the invention of computers, but a remarkable shift in understanding its fundamental nature occurs, in fact, before our eyes. The present moment, in fact, is a transition from the concept of computer science as an artificial science to the understanding that information processes are abundant in nature. Computing is recognized as a natural science that studies natural and artificial information processes. In everyday computing, operations are performed on the individual generators, with little attention paid to their internal structure. However, many common operations consist of more primitive constructions connected by a combination mode. The interaction of information processes and corresponding structures is carried out in an environment of “applicative interaction”, their applications to each other, and the study of the properties of this environment allows us to understand the nature of the computations. In the present work, the main attention is paid to elucidating the technological features of computations with individual generators, or objects. Their interaction is considered in an applicative environment, which allows us to elucidate the internal structure of ordinary operations, the knowledge of which allows us to understand their properties. The choice of initial constant generators, considered as generic ones and expressed by combinators, is discussed. These initial generators are used as the main “building blocks” that occur within the larger blocks of the applicative environment in interaction with each other.

The study findings indicated that participants developed significantly more positive dispositions toward mathematics after computer game making. The study also found that experience-driven game design processes helped to activate children's reflection on everyday mathematical experiences.

article,SIGAYRET2022104505,"In recent years, computer programming has reappeared in school curricula with the aim of transmitting knowledge and skills beyond the simple ability to code. However, there are different ways of teaching this subject and very few experimental studies compare plugged-in and unplugged programming learning. The purpose of this study is to highlight the impact of plugged-in or unplugged learning on students' performance and subjective experience. To this end, we designed an experimental study with 217 primary school students divided into two groups and we measured their knowledge of computational concepts, ability to solve algorithmic problem, motivation toward the instruction, self-belief and attitude toward science. The programming sessions were designed to be similar between the two conditions, only the tools were different. Computers and Scratch software were used in the plugged-in group while the unplugged group used paper instructions, pictures, figurines and body movements instead. The results show better learning performance in the plugged-in group. Furthermore, although motivation dropped slightly in both groups, this drop was only significant in the unplugged condition. Gender also seems to be an important factor, as girls exhibit a lower post-test motivation and a lower willingness to pursue their practice in programming outside the school context. However, this effect on motivation was only observable in the plugged-in group which suggests that educational programming software may have a positive but gendered motivational impact.",,Kevin Sigayret and André Tricot and Nathalie Blanc,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104505,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"Elementary education, Improving classroom teaching, Programming and programming languages, Teaching/learning strategies",,104505,,Unplugged or plugged-in programming learning: A comparative experimental study,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131522000768,184,2022,,
article,GOBL2023100604,"Digital literacy and respective education are of growing interest in our increasingly digitalized world. Recent works stress the importance of aiming beyond the acquisition of corresponding technical competences and call for fostering children’s empowerment and participation in digitalization. Computational Empowerment (CE) pursues that goal through a creative and reflexive participatory design approach. However, remaining conceptual vagueness with regard to what CE entails may hinder its implementation in formal education. This paper addresses this gap, with the aim to demonstrate what is needed to advance CE’s position in this context. To this end, we elaborate on our understanding of CE’s vision, approach and impact. We then examine CE in the context of formal education, and contrast it with selected contemporary educational theory and practice. Specifically, we position CE in relation to an established learning framework (Bloom’s revised taxonomy), educational policy (DigComp) and practices in the classroom. This is complemented by an analysis of four different projects: we present lessons learned in the context of pedagogical interventions and take a closer look at the accompanying empowerment processes. As a result, this paper provides a foundation to make CE’s ideas more tangible and, thus, actionable, for researchers, policy makers and educators.",,Barbara Göbl and Elisabeth Anna Guenther and Fares Kayali and Christopher Frauenberger,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcci.2023.100604,,,,2212-8689,International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction,"Computational empowerment, Digital competences, Digital literacy, Empowerment, Participatory design",,100604,,Situating computational empowerment in formal education: A multi-perspective view,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212868923000417,38,2023,,

Results verified the positive impact of gamification in programming education. Gamification has the largest effect on students' motivation, followed by academic achievement, whereas it has the least effect on students' cognitive load. As for game types, the reasoning strategy game is most effective on academic achievement, while the puzzle game is most effective on motivation. As for gamification application, the games as a competitive mechanism has the greatest impact on students’ thinking skills and motivation.

article,BRADY2022101156,"Many block-based programming environments have proven to be effective at engaging novices in learning programming. However, most offer only restricted access to the outside world, limiting learners to commands and computing resources built in to the environment. Some allow learners to drag and drop files, connect to sensors and robots locally or issue HTTP requests. But in a world where most of the applications in our daily lives are distributed (i.e., their functionality depends on communicating with other computers or accessing resources and data on the internet), the limited support for beginners to envision and create such distributed programs is a lost opportunity. We argue that it is feasible to create environments with simple yet powerful abstractions that open up distributed computing and other widely-used but advanced computing concepts including networking, the Internet of Things, and cybersecurity to novices. The paper presents the architecture of and design decisions behind NetsBlox, a programming environment that supports these ideas. We show how NetsBlox expands opportunities for learning considerably: NetsBlox projects can access a wealth of online data and web services, and they can communicate with other projects. Moreover, the tool infrastructure enables young learners to collaborate with each other during program construction, whether they share their physical location or study remotely. Importantly, providing access to the wider world will also help counter widespread student perceptions that block-based environments are mere toys, and show that they are capable of creating compelling applications.

In addition, t tests, ANCOVA, and ANOVA were used to analyze the data to determine whether REP could improve students’ creativity better than PBP. The results showed that REP could enhance students’ creative self-efficacy and their robotic creative products score more than PBP could, but not the TTCT-Figural score after the confounding effect of fluency was controlled for. In the intervention group, creative self-efficacy and creative thinking were improved after intervention. Overall, REP has more advantages than PBP for promoting primary school students' creativity. The findings of this study provide a reference and teaching strategies guidance for the cultivation of K-12 students' creativity in robotics education.",,Xiaohong Liu and Jianjun Gu and Li Zhao,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsc.2023.101339,,,,1871-1871,Thinking Skills and Creativity,"Creativity, Reverse engineering pedagogy, Creative thinking, Robotics education, Creative self-efficacy",,101339,,Promoting primary school students’ creativity via reverse engineering pedagogy in robotics education,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187123001086,49,2023,,
article,SHARMA2022100536,"Educational research has used the information extracted from facial expressions to explain learning performance in various educational settings like collaborative learning. Leveraging this, we extracted the emotions based upon two different theoretical frameworks from videos with children aged 13–16 while collaborating to create games using Scratch. The two sets of emotions are based on the control value theory (happiness, sadness, anger, surprise) and the education-specific expressions (frustration, boredom, confusion, delight). We computed the groups’ objective performance, which was calculated based on their created artifacts. We divided them into high and low performance and compared them based on individual emotions’ duration and the transitions among the emotions. We also used the subjective indication of their perceived performance from a self-reported questionnaire, divided them into another performance category, and did a similar analysis with the objective performance. Results show that the objective performance is better explained by the education-specific emotions and the negative valance emotions from the control value theory-based emotions. On the other hand, subjective performance is better explained by the control value theory based on emotions.

This new user-centered paradigm — known as the NUI — aims to provide a more natural and rich experience to end users; this supports its adoption in many ubiquitous domains, as it naturally holds for Pervasive Displays: these systems are composed of variously-sized displays and support many-to-many interactions with the same public screens at the same time. Due to their public and moderated nature, users need an easy way of adapting them to heterogeneous usage contexts in order to support their long-term adoption. In this paper, we propose an End-User Development approach to this problem introducing TAPAS, a system that combines a tangible interaction with a puzzle metaphor, allowing users to create workflows on a Pervasive Display to satisfy their needs; its design and visual syntax stem from a study we carried out with designers, whose findings are also part of this work.

article,YANG2022100061,"Artificial intelligence (AI) education has posed fundamental challenges to early childhood education (ECE), including (1) why AI is necessary and appropriate for learning in the early years, (2) what is the subset of key AI ideas and concepts that can be learned by children, and (3) how to engage children in a meaningful experience that allows them to acquire these fundamental AI concepts. This report from the ECE field discusses the key considerations for developing an AI curriculum for young children. These key considerations altogether present an innovative pedagogical model for AI literacy education in early childhood. This model argues that AI literacy is an organic part of digital literacy for all citizens in an increasingly intelligent society. The core AI knowledge that can be explored with young children is: Using large amounts of data input, AI algorithms can be continuously trained to identify patterns, make predictions, and recommend actions, even though with limitations. Based on the theoretical notions of learning-by-making and pedagogy-as-relational, an embodied, culturally responsive approach should be used to enable young children's exploration with AI technologies. Finally, an exemplary curriculum named “AI for Kids” is introduced to demonstrate this pedagogical model and explain how educators can provide children culturally responsive inquiry opportunities to interact with and understand AI technologies.

article,HARRIS2023101038,"The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of spatial visualization skills when students solve area tasks. Spatial visualization is closely related to mathematics achievement, but little is known about how these skills link to task success. We examined middle school students’ representations and solutions to area problems (both non-metric and metric) through qualitative and quantitative task analysis. Task solutions were analyzed as a function of spatial visualization skills and links were made between student solutions on tasks with different goals (i.e., non-metric and metric). Findings suggest that strong spatial visualizers solved the tasks with relative ease, with evidence for conceptual and procedural understanding. By contrast, Low and Average Spatial students more frequently produced errors due to failure to correctly determine linear measurements or apply appropriate formula, despite adequate procedural knowledge. A novel finding was the facilitating role of spatial skills in the link between metric task representation and success in determining a solution. From a teaching and learning perspective, these results highlight the need to connect emergent spatial skills with mathematical content and support students to develop conceptual understanding in parallel with procedural competence.",,Danielle Harris and Tracy Logan and Tom Lowrie,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmathb.2023.101038,,,,0732-3123,The Journal of Mathematical Behavior,"Spatial visualization, Measurement, Area, Learning pathways",,101038,,Spatial visualization and measurement of area: A case study in spatialized mathematics instruction,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732312323000081,70,2023,,

article,LAAKSO2021104308,"Background
This exploratory study engaged teams of elementary and middle school students in the collaborative design of digital games. Game design is theoretically examined in this study as a form of knowledge-creating learning that is characterized by collaborative efforts to advance a shared object of activity, i.e., the game being designed. Using mixed methods, we examined how students experienced the game design project and how the project fostered connected learning, that is, integration of students’ personal interests and supportive peer relations with their schoolwork, and how their self-assessed digital competences developed.
Methods
The digital competences of 98 comprehensive school students across Finland were traced using pre- and post-questionnaires. The post-questionnaire also included validated measures on connected learning. Quantitative methods were used to analyze structured measures, and qualitative methods were used to analyze open-ended measures.
Findings
Students experienced game design as an inspiring, challenging activity. Game design engaged student teams in sustained, collaborative efforts to create shared digital artifacts. Their efforts involved a great deal of mutual support and knowledge sharing. Participation also improved students’ self-reported technical and artistic digital competences. The game design project fostered informal, interest-driven, sociodigital participation; inspired learning engagement; and improved schoolwork practices.
Contribution
The game design project appeared to be a pedagogically meaningful way of engaging students in knowledge-creating learning and of connecting students' formal and informal learning. The project sparked students’ motivation to learn, fostered digital competences, and enriched the learning environment.",,Noora L. Laakso and Tiina S. Korhonen and Kai P.J.

article,LEE2015241,"Concerning the marginalization of computer science education in K-12 STEM education in the United States, this study examined the extent to which taking more credits in computer science courses at the secondary level predicts students' STEM major choices in postsecondary institutions in the U.S., by comparison to the well-documented predictors of students' STEM major choices after controlling for student demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, SES, and racial background). These predictors include credits earned in math and science courses as well as ACT math scores. Drawing on a nationally representative sample of U.S. young adults who were 12th graders in 2004 and disclosed their college majors by 2006, logistic regression analyses revealed that students who took more units in computer science courses were significantly more likely to choose STEM majors in both 4-year and 2-year postsecondary institutions. Moreover, regardless of the type of postsecondary institutions that students attended, taking more units in computer science courses played a significant role in choosing STEM majors. In addition, the effects of computer science education on student STEM major selection were equally as strong as the effects of math and science education. The results suggest that promoting the quality of computer science education is just as important in motivating students to pursue STEM education and career choices at the secondary level as are math and science education.",,Ahlam Lee,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2015.04.019,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"Computer science course, STEM major choice, Postsecondary institutions",,241-255,,Determining the effects of computer science education at the secondary level on STEM major choices in postsecondary institutions in the United States,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131515001219,88,2015,,

The purpose of this study is threefold: (a) examine a CS professional development program built around high-quality design features reported in the research literature, (b) investigate the impact of the program on participating teachers’ learning and classroom practice, and (c) identify specific design features that facilitated changes in teacher learning and practice. The study employed a mixed-methods design. Data were collected from multiple sources including, pre and post survey data on teacher knowledge of CS content, pedagogy, and technology (N = 94), as well as interviews and classroom implementation data from eight case study participants. Findings from this work indicated that participants reported improvements in their knowledge of CS content, pedagogy, and technology. They also applied new learning into their practice, though implementation varied among participants. Responding on the value of the professional development design features, teachers noted the importance of focusing on CS content knowledge as well as opportunities to engage with pedagogical practices for teaching computing. Findings also indicated the important role of contextualized follow-up classroom support in the implementation of new learning into practice.

article,SWEET201633,"As software interfaces become more intuitive and require less technical expertise, the robotic arm is not only becoming a tool for automating bespoke construction, it is becoming a tool to help bring the concept of the “Master Builder” back to the architectural profession. Being analogous to a human arm, it is easy to imagine limitless possibilities the robotic arm. However, understanding and utilizing it for the purpose of construction requires more knowledge than just imagining it as prosthetic. Besides a fundamental understanding of the digital workflow from the initial design based data (3D modelling) to machine understandable data (proprietary output code), it requires the design and conception of the robot's physical environment from the tool at the end of its arm (end effector) to its physical surroundings(work cell). Contemporary software tools provide the capabilities for manufacturing purposes and allow for virtual simulations of the production process, ensuring higher rates of success for construction. It is the crossover between the virtual environment and the physical world that will empower architects of the future to reclaim the title of master builders as they will be required to not only comprehend but design and participate in the entire building process inclusive of the manufacturing of components.

Digital fabrication (DF) and design thinking (DT) have been suggested as approaches to developing students’ understanding of technology and their agency in a digitised world. However, nowadays teachers are not being trained in this field. In order to prepare the next generation for a rapidly changing and unknown future heavily influenced by computing it thus seems necessary to focus on the professional development (PD) of teachers. This study investigates how development of professional practice can be conducted to empower teachers and principals to implement DF and DT activities in schools. Initially, the paper gives an overview of nine educational initiatives in the field, followed by a closer examination of the Danish FabLab@SCHOOLdk organisation. The paper identifies the different PD programmes aimed at empowering in-service teachers, pedagogues, and principals in the field of DF and DT. As the main contribution to the research community, the study identifies five important stakeholders that are supporting and operating in synergy inside the FabLab@SCHOOLdk initiative as well as the surrounding gatekeepers with influence on the development processes.

article,HENDRICKX2021100474,"HIV viral load (VL) is an important predictor of HIV progression and transmission. Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has been reported to reduce HIV transmission by lowering VL. However, apart from this beneficial effect, increased levels of population mean set-point viral load (SPVL), an estimator for HIV virulence, have been observed in men who have sex with men (MSM) in the decade following the introduction of ART in The Netherlands. Several studies have been devoted to explain these counter-intuitive trends in SPVL. However, to our knowledge, none of these studies has investigated an explanation in which it arises as the result of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) co-factor in detail. In this study, we adapted an event-based, individual-based model to investigate how STI co-infection and sexual risk behaviour affect the evolution of HIV SPVL in MSM before and after the introduction of ART. The results suggest that sexual risk behaviour has an effect on SPVL and indicate that more data are needed to test the effect of STI co-factors on SPVL. Furthermore, the observed trends in SPVL cannot be explained by sexual risk behaviour and STI co-factors only.

This study examines how highly-specialised research is made comprehensible to non-specialist audiences through “code glosses”, communication strategies that function to facilitate understanding by reformulating, explaining, or elaborating on what has been said (Hyland, 2005). Analysing a corpus of 50 successful 3MT presentations in the electrical and computer engineering discipline, we found code glosses to be one of the most frequently used interactive metadiscourse types in the data. Significantly, Analogies and Definitions emerged as salient-enough features in our data that we added them as additional categories of code gloss, extending Hyland's (2007) two categories of Exemplifiers and Reformulators. Our analysis shows how examples, definitions, analogies, and reformulations are used in distinct ways in 3MT presentations to make the presented research accessible, coherent, and engaging to audiences.

article,ISMAILOVA2022463,"This paper considers the application of conceptual mathematics to construct a computational model of concepts and individuals. An applicative approach is systematically applied to build a concept-as-process design. Since modern computing considers information processes as the main objects of modeling, the developed design is indeed representative of the semantic processing of information. The nature of concepts – what concepts are – and the constraints that govern the theory of concepts have been, and continue to be, the subject of debate. It is especially interesting to discuss the nature of concepts in connection with the recently established fundamental nature of information processes that are attributable to all phenomena and events occurring in the world around us. The current trend elevates information processes to forms of computing, which can also be implemented through practices, for example, in the form of programming. The deep component is computational models, one way or another expressed by means of mathematics and metamathematics. The main meta-operations used are abstraction and application. Of greatest interest is functional abstraction and application in the form of applying a function to an argument. Despite this “conceptual minimalism”, a rich theory of concepts can be developed. Using this theory, it is possible to focus further discussion not only on the nature of concepts, but also to characterize the position on each of the five important issues that are central to many theories of concepts: (1) ontology of concepts, (2) structure of concepts, (3) empiricism, and nativism about concepts, (4) concepts and natural language, and (5) concepts and conceptual analysis.",,Larisa Ismailova and Viacheslav Wolfengagen and Sergey Kosikov,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2022.11.092,,,,1877-0509,Procedia Computer Science,"concept-as-a-process, application, abstraction, conceptual minimalism, computational model",,463-470,,Applicative approach to construe a computational model of concepts and individuals,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050922017835,213,2022,2022 Annual International Conference on Brain-Inspired Cognitive Architectures for Artificial Intelligence: The 13th Annual Meeting of the BICA Society,

Increasingly, these environments are moving into the “cloud” where they can be accessed through web browsers and run on a variety of devices including tablets and smartphones. The shift to online settings enables a variety of powerful pedagogical features to be incorporated into the design of these learning environments, including making it easy to share learner-authored programs, browse projects written by others, and allow learners to incorporate various Internet resources into their work. Further, the Internet itself can serve as a productive canvas upon which novice programmers can create in the form of dynamic and interactive web pages. This shift in venue for authoring and editing programs is particularly well-suited for young learners growing up in an increasingly online world. In this paper, we present theoretical and practical arguments for online introductory programming environments as powerful learning tools and present data showing various ways young learners take advantage of features of the environment enabled by being situated online.

article,ASARE2022100433,"The scaling up of antiretroviral therapy services over the past decades has led to a remarkable reduction in HIV infections and HIV-related deaths in South Africa (SA). While this is a step in the right direction, it brings a new public health challenge into focus, namely psychological challenges associated with such chronic and often stigmatising condition in SA, home to the largest HIV epidemic. Given the current lack of national-level evidence, we investigated the role of the HIV epidemic on depression onset in SA using nationally representative panel data from the South African National Income Dynamics Study (SA-NIDS). Our incident cohort consisted of 13,020 sampled adult participants who were depression-free in Wave 4 (baseline year of 2015). We then measured the risk of depression onset in Wave 5 (year 2017) based on the level of HIV prevalence in the community where study participants resided at baseline. A High-resolution map of HIV spatial heterogeneity (i.e., community HIV prevalence) was generated using ordinary kriging mapping methods from a separate nationally representative data source that corresponded to the investigation period. Geospatial analyses were conducted to identify the spatial structure of HIV and depression onset, and generalised estimating equations (GEE) regression models were fitted to determine the risk of depression onset over time based on community HIV prevalence. Our geospatial analyses indicated that HIV and depression onset prevalence spatially overlapped in the eastern part of the country, particularly in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, and Free State province. The GEE regression analyses indicated that individual residency in a community with high HIV prevalence was significantly associated with a higher risk of depression than a low HIV prevalence community (adjusted odds ratio =1.45, 95% CI=1.12-1.48). For the first time, we identified a geospatial overlap between HIV and depression, with a greater risk of depression onset in high HIV prevalence communities, at a national scale in SA.

article,CAGLAR2015255,"Despite their advanced status, nations such as the United States of America continue to face a STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) crisis in their education system. Lack of effective teaching modalities that can leverage real-world examples to stimulate student interest in STEM concepts are identified as one of the reasons for this crisis. To address these challenges, our research is investigating the use of innovative and attractive modeling and simulation frameworks for concurrent, interactive and collaborative STEM education where vehicular traffic serves as the real-world example to reify STEM concepts. Existing traffic-related tools, such as traffic simulators, however, do not provide: (1) intuitive abstractions to construct, refine, and simulate various traffic models that are commensurate to the level of high school students, (2) concurrent and scalable model execution, and (3) collaborative learning environments. On the other hand, although intuitive abstractions such as Google Maps exist, these abstractions do not support semantics for dynamic behavior, which is representative of real-world traffic scenarios. To overcome both these challenges and address the STEM problem, this paper presents a Cloud-based, Collaborative, and Scaled-up Modeling and Simulation Framework for STEM Education called C2SuMo. The key contribution of this paper lies in the design and implementation of a cloud-based, elastic modeling and simulation framework that provides an intuitive, model-driven, collaborative, and concurrent visual simulation environment for STEM education.

article,GONG2024101641,"Remixing is a balance between imitation and originality, which gets a lot of attention as an important source of creative behaviors. Exploring the relationship between the Scratch project and its remix would provide a new perspective for understanding users’ creative behaviors. To this end, this study used 20 projects and their 957 remixes as samples to analyze creative behavior in Scratch through quantitative statistics and correlation analysis. Three research questions are addressed: (1) What creative levels are there among the remixes? (2) What relationships are there between the project and its remixes? and (3) What creative trends are there indicated in the remixes? The main results are concluded as follows. First, four creative levels of remixes based on the SOLO taxonomy are found, including feature change, appearance change, element creation, and structure creation. Feature change has the highest sum of remixes, which indicates that most remixes are at a low creative level. Second, the internal characteristics of projects are related to the lower creative level of remix, while the external characteristics are attached to the higher creative level of remix. Finally, the two-level, three-level, and four-level iteration chain of remixes are found, in which remixes with high creativity is more likely to inspire remixes with lower or equal creativity. Based on these results, suggestions for further research and improvement are discussed.

article,ISMAILOVA2021317,"The paper considers methods to organize a network of links to parameterized data objects. A data object is an object identified by standard methods, including the network identifiers URI, URL and URN. The data objects can be either atomic or have a complex structure, including links to other objects, and this ensures the linking of objects into a network, which can be considered as an information graph. It turns out to be possible to formulate a number of criteria for supporting the integrity of such a structure; the paper proposes language tools to formulate such criteria. An essential feature of this network is the dependence of the objects’ information content on a number of parameters, first of all, on time. Depending on the parameter, the information content of the object can change both with the preservation of the integrity of the structure, and with its damage. The paper considers methods for a parameterized description of objects while maintaining integrity based on the formalism of category theory. The formalization used allows defining two relations between objects and their names (identifiers): access and links. The paper studies the basic properties of such relations and reveals the differences between them. Category theoretical means of describing objects require appropriate support tools for practical application. The paper proposes a configuration of support tools for a network of links to parameterized data objects based on a combination of conceptual modeling tools and applicative computing tools. The proposed tools provide basic methods of access to the network of information graphs. An essential feature of the proposed tools is the ability to determine the subjective way of considering the information graph (based on the category of correlations), as well as harmonizing an objective and subjective way of considering. The proposed tools were tested in the development of applied information systems in the field of implementation of the best available technologies (BAT).",,Larisa Ismailova and Sergey Kosikov and Viacheslav Wolfengagen,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2021.06.042,,,,1877-0509,Procedia Computer Science,"data objects, object identification, conceptual constructions, informational graph, semantics, category theory, model parametrization",,317-323,,Prototype Mechanisms for Supporting the Network of Links to Parameterized Data Objects,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050921012862,190,2021,2020 Annual International Conference on Brain-Inspired Cognitive Architectures for Artificial Intelligence: Eleventh Annual Meeting of the BICA Society,

Recurrent disease outbreaks caused by a range of emerging and resurging pathogens over the past decade reveal major gaps in public health preparedness, detection, and response systems in Africa.

The growing trend of orienting technological innovation in the building sector towards the eco-efficiency of industrial manufacturing processes increasingly requires to identify methods and tools able to support the design/manufacturing/construction process as a whole. In this sense, the intellectual and operational dimension of design is discovering a new digital and data-driven technological paradigm. Digital tools are pushing the investigation of the building component manufacturing process into an increasingly virtual dimension, in which the constant integration between environmental and material/geometric parameters identifies the meta-design phase as the “ideal place” to experiment the creative use of data and technical knowledge. Starting from these assumptions, the paper illustrates an original design methodology and the related digital/parametric workflow aimed at optimizing performances and production of a façade shading system realized in UHPFRC (Ultra High-Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete).

article,GOOD201778,"Given the current focus on teaching computational concepts to all from an early age, combined with the growing trend to empower end users to become producers of technology rather than mere consumers, we consider the issue of “computational notation”. Specifically, where the goal is to help individuals develop their understanding of computation and/or use computation in real world settings, we question whether natural language might be a preferred notation to traditional programming languages, given its familiarity and ubiquity. We describe three empirical studies investigating the use of natural language for computation in which we found that although natural language provides support for understanding computational concepts, it introduces additional difficulties when used for coding. We distilled our findings into a set of design guidelines for novice programming environments which consider the ways in which different notations, including natural language, can best support the various activities that comprise programming. These guidelines were embodied in Flip, a bi-modal programming language used in conjunction with the Electron toolset, which allows young people to create their own commercial quality, narrative based role- playing games. Two empirical studies on the use of Flip in three different real world contexts considered the extent to which the design guidelines support ease of use and an understanding of computation. The guidelines have potential to be of use both in analysing the use of natural language in existing novice programming environments, and in the design of new ones.",,Judith Good and Kate Howland,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvlc.2016.10.008,,,,1045-926X,Journal of Visual Languages & Computing,"Novice programming languages, Natural language, Design, Empirical evaluation",,78-92,,"Programming language, natural language?

article,NYONI2022100434,"Background
There is an alarming trend in sub-Saharan Africa in the use of codeine-containing pharmaceuticals, but its risk of common comorbidities, such as mental health, remains unquantified at a national-level. We investigated the relationship between codeine use and onset of depression in South Africa at a population-level.
Methods
We used nationally representative panel data from the South Africa National Income Dynamic Study to investigate the relationship between exposure to codeine use in the community (i.e. residing in a codeine hotspot) and onset of depression. Geographical hotspots of codeine use were identified using Kulldorff spatial scan statistic in SaTScan. We quantified depression onset at Wave 5 (year 2017) between individuals residing inside and outside a codeine hotspot who were depression-free at enrolment (Wave 4: 2015) using generalised estimating equation (GEE) regression models.
Results
We identified four statistically significant hotspots of codeine use, mostly located at the northern part of the country. Among 13,020 participants who were depression-free at enrolment, residing within a codeine use hotspot was significantly associated with higher subsequent onset of depression (aRR=1.21, 95% CI:1.08-1.44).
Limitations
Data on diagnosis of depressive disorder were not available.
Conclusion
South Africa, a resource scarce nation with chronically limited mental health services, is not spared from the global opioid epidemic and its impact on depression. Targeted scale-up access to agonist therapy to effectively treat (opioid) addiction in communities at risk for high exposure to codeine use could reduce the risk of subsequent mental health challenges.",,Princess Nyoni and Diego F.

article,GENNARI2023103006,"Digital well-being traditionally means limiting the effects on individuals of technology abuses. However, in a broader perspective, it can be crucial to consider the pervasiveness of technology, and the effect it can have not only on individuals but also on their peers in the context of diverse everyday-life situations. Within this view, which emphasises the social side of digital well-being, the paper argues the need of educating young generations to participate in the making of technology for a social goal and have a reflective attitude towards technology and its impact on society. It, therefore, presents a design toolkit as a means to (i) engage young generations to become active in design for social digital well-being and, thanks to the exposure to how technology works, (ii) reflect deeply on the pros and cons of technology in use in their everyday life. By presenting the results of a study with 24 high-school pupils and their teachers, the paper discusses how a phygital toolkit, which structures the design process, engages them in the rapid prototyping of their own smart things, and how it acts as a proxy for soliciting their own reflections around technology and social digital well-being.",,Rosella Gennari and Maristella Matera and Diego Morra and Alessandra Melonio and Mehdi Rizvi,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2023.103006,,,,1071-5819,International Journal of Human-Computer Studies,"Digital well-being, Social digital well-being, Responsible design, Smart-thing design, Toolkit",,103006,,Design for social digital well-being with young generations: Engage them and make them reflect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581923000125,173,2023,,

article,SIMOESGOMES201877,"The inclusion of programming topics in the initial grades of school gives rise to debates about the best ways to teach these contents. Programmable toys, activities with physical materials and various games are some of the resources available. Amongst those, digital games possess important elements for learning programming, such as incremental challenges, personalised immediate feedback, and visualisation of the consequences of errors. In this work, we explore the results of an experience based on digital games for teaching programming concepts to young children. Our aim was to investigate how such concepts are presented in the games’ interface and what is the impact of the interaction elements on children’s comprehension. This work took place in Informatics classes of a Brazilian school, with 42 students aged 5 to 7 years. Data were collected through participant observation, and semi-structured and unstructured interviews, focusing on the main difficulties faced by the children when interacting with the games. Topics, skills and competences were considered according to the syllabus proposed by Computing at School, and encompassed sequences of instructions, repetition loops and conditionals. Results indicate a satisfactory understanding of sequences of instructions and conditionals, but also show challenges with respect to graphical symbols, text and interaction elements identified as hard to understand for the children, making the support of an adult fundamental. Another critical point was the comprehension of the concept of repetition, which made the use of complementary approaches necessary, in particular unplugged playful activities. This shows that despite the increasing number of available digital games that involve programming basics, good solutions for conveying the main concepts to young children have not yet been found, demanding further investigation, possibly towards structured hybrid approaches combining digital games and unplugged activities.",,Tancicleide Carina {Simões Gomes} and Taciana {Pontual Falcão} and Patrícia {Cabral de Azevedo Restelli Tedesco},,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcci.2017.12.005,,,,2212-8689,International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction,"Digital games, Young children, Programming, Child-game interaction",,77-84,,Exploring an approach based on digital games for teaching programming concepts to young children,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212868917300338,16,2018,,

Researchers have developed various assessments for maker activities to examine students' learning outcomes. However, a systematic review of research on such assessments is lacking. To fill this gap, we reviewed empirical studies on maker-based assessments in education. We systematically examined 60 studies regarding the overall features of the maker activities, the learning outcomes that were measured, the assessment formats, and the psychometric evidence of the assessments. Our review results indicate that more than 20 types of maker platforms have been employed in the activities, with e-textiles and LilyPad Arduino being the most popular. Five types of assessment tools have been used prevalently to examine students' diverse learning outcomes, specifically artifact assessments, tests, surveys, interviews, and observations. Most assessments are used in STEM-related maker activities, especially technology-centric activities, to measure STEM-related learning outcomes. Only 15% of the studies provide psychometric evidence of reliability and validity for the assessments.

This study adopts the theoretical lens of New Literacy studies to suggest a combined perspective for investigating social media literacies. This perspective considers both social media skills that are transversal across different social media (global skills), and those that pertain to a specific social media platform (local skills). It examines practices that are decontextualized (literacy as something to be acquired), and those that are situated and context-dependent (literacy through participation). To map current research on social media skills, a systematic literature review was conducted. Analysis of 54 publications was carried out following the UNESCO DLGF framework for digital literacy competencies, and also using a critical lens based on four metaphors whereby, for learning purposes, social media are seen as a tool, as a process, as collaboration, and as participation. The results show that most of the studies consider global social media skills, while only a few examine skills sets specific to a particular social media platform. In addition, most of the identified skills concern decontextualized practices, with very few studies emphasizing the importance of fostering situated social media practices.

article,WANG2021100031,"Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) has been the focus of significant attention in recent years because of its growing social importance and pedagogical value. In Hong Kong, an increasing number of K-12 schools are planning or piloting their grassroots AIED incorporation practices. However, progress is reportedly slow due to a number of barriers. Unfortunately, because of their limited scope, disputed interpretations and contextual irrelevance, current research literature seems to be of limited referencing value in aiding schools to address the issues and overcome the barriers. This paper highlights the necessity of embracing AIED as wide-ranging given the current understanding of it as a collective notion. Three major directions of AIED are identified: Learning from AI, Learning about AI, and Learning with AI. A collective case study, which examined the perceived barriers to AIED incorporation in Hong Kong K-12 schools with different AIED directions, was conducted. Qualitative data were gathered via ten semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from two schools. Ertmer’s (1999) typology was applied to segregate the barriers. The findings showed that both first-order and second-order barriers existed, although they varied between the cases. It was also found that the barriers did not hinder in isolation but appeared to be interconnected. The findings suggest that schools use differentiated strategies to tackle barriers according to their approach to incorporating AIED.

However, little research has explored how parents and children use coding apps together for learning, and whether specific parent-child interactions in these contexts promote children's learning from apps. Therefore, we observed 31 parents and their 4.5- to 5.0-year old children playing a coding app together and coded for spatial talk, question-asking, task-relevant talk, and responsiveness. Results show that parents and children engaged in high-quality interactions during coding app play, with parents and children exhibiting high responsiveness and task-relevant talk, and parents exhibiting a higher proportion of question-asking and spatial talk compared to their children. Importantly, linear regression analyses show that the dyad's ability to stay on task during the coding task predicts children's learning of coding, while question-asking was a negative predictor of children's learning.

Four domains of competence were identified: technology competences, competences for pedagogical and educational technology use, beliefs about teaching and learning and competences in professional learning. The literature focuses on teacher educators’ competences in using technology for teaching. Research on the competences that teacher educators need and have as second-order teachers is lacking. Recommendations for future research are discussed.",,Dana Uerz and Monique Volman and Marijke Kral,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tate.2017.11.005,,,,0742-051X,Teaching and Teacher Education,"Teacher educators, Teaching and learning with technology/technology integration, Technological competences, Second-order teacher/role model/modelling, Professional development, Systematic review",,12-23,,Teacher educators' competences in fostering student teachers’ proficiency in teaching and learning with technology: An overview of relevant research literature,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742051X17304936,70.0,2018,,
article,CANNADY2019101802,"Science consists of a body of knowledge and a set of processes by which the knowledge is produced. Although these have traditionally been treated separately in science instruction, there has been a shift to an integration of knowledge and processes, or set of practices, in how science should be taught and assessed. We explore whether a general overall mastery of the processes drives learning in new science content areas and if this overall mastery can be improved through engaged science learning. Through a review of literature, the paper conceptualizes this general process mastery as scientific sensemaking, defines the sub-dimensions, and presents a new measure of the construct centered in scenarios of general interest to young adolescents. Using a dataset involving over 2500 6th and 8th grade students, the paper shows that scientific sensemaking scores can predict content learning gains and that this relationship is consistent across student characteristics, content of instruction, and classroom environment. Further, students who are behaviorally and cognitively engaged during science classroom activities show greater growth in scientific sensemaking, showing a reciprocal relationship between sensemaking ability and effective science instruction. Findings from this work support early instruction on sensemaking activities to better position students to learn new scientific content.",,Matthew A.

article,ERIKSSON20189,"Digital fabrication and making has received a growing interest in formal and informal learning environments. However, many of these initiatives often start from a grassroots perspective, with little coordination on a national level. This paper illustrates and discusses a study from an ongoing large-scale national testbed in Sweden named Makerspace in schools (Makerskola). The project embodies a series of considerations that arise when a maker approach is applied to a geographically widespread national education context. The results of this study are based on an analysis of the extensive project documentation and first-hand experiences from initiating and running a large-scale national testbed in Sweden, involving more than 30 formal actors and more than one thousand active partners in a national educational setting.

One key challenge is that a player may deploy several interweaved and overlapped skills during gameplay, making the assessment task nontrivial. In this research, we present a generalizable DKT approach called GameDKT that integrates state-of-the-art machine learning with domain knowledge to model the learners’ knowledge state during gameplay, in an attempt to monitor and trace their proficiency level for the different skills required for educational games. Our findings reveal that GameDKT approach could successfully predict the performance of players in the coming game task using the cross-validated CNN model with accuracy and AUC of roughly 85% and 0.913, respectively, thus outperforming the MLP baseline model by up to 14%. When the performance of players is forecasted for up to four game tasks in advance, results show that the CNN model can achieve more than 70% accuracy.

article,MCDONALD202239,"The use of theory and simulation in undergraduate education in biochemistry, molecular biology, and structural biology is now common, but the skills students need and the curriculum instructors have to train their students are evolving. The global pandemic and the immediate switch to remote instruction forced instructors to reconsider how they can use computation to teach concepts previously approached with other instructional methods. In this review, we survey some of the curricula, materials, and resources for instructors who want to include theory, simulation, and computation in the undergraduate curriculum. There has been a notable progression from teaching students to use discipline-specific computational tools to developing interactive computational tools that promote active learning to having students write code themselves, such that they view computation as another tool for solving problems. We are moving toward a future where computational skills, including programming, data analysis, visualization, and simulation, will no longer be considered an optional bonus for students but a required skill for the 21st century STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) workforce; therefore, all physical and life science students should learn to program in the undergraduate curriculum.",,Ashley Ringer McDonald and Rebecca Roberts and Julia R.

article,AKTOPRAK2022101029,"Critical thinking is an effective skill that allows students to be successful in the continually changing world by playing a role in their thinking development. Although the significance of critical thinking in primary education has been discussed in many studies, the number of studies conducted on the subject is limited. This study aims to systematically review and analyse the literature by taking a holistic approach to previous studies in order to clearly identify the gaps in the field and the steps to be taken for future studies. In this context, two different analysis methods were employed in the study. This review aims to reveal information that has not been fully captured or evaluated previously, including information related to important sources, documents, countries, and keywords used in the field. According to the results obtained from the study, the country with the highest publication performance is the United States of America, and the most cited publication source is the Journal of Thinking Skills and Creativity. The most frequently studied concepts in the documents are identified as 21st century skills, assessment, creativity, learning, teaching, teacher, education, and primary school. Another result obtained reveals that articles on critical thinking, which increased between 2015 and 2020, mostly discussed critical thinking in the fields of mathematics and science education. Studies that examine the development of critical thinking skills through the implementation of different teaching methods are particularly in the majority. According to the analysis results of the article methodologies, it is revealed that the majority are based on the qualitative research approach, the criterion sampling method is used with small sample groups, and the most preferred data collection tool is the document.

article,CAI2022102180,"Mathematics learning is not only determined by mathematical contents, but also by reading strategies that students apply to comprehend the mathematical tasks. Although studies in mathematics education have shown that reading strategies are positively related to mathematics learning, the relation may not be linear as widely believed. Recent research in language assessment has found that the association between reading strategies and reading performance fluctuates as language proficiency increases, a pattern metaphorically called the Island Ridge Curve (IRC). Inspired by the IRC, we hypothesize that the relation between reading strategies and mathematics learning also fluctuates in the pattern of the IRC as students' reading proficiency increases. To verify this assumption, we used a public dataset of 529,091 15-year-old students (M = 15.79, SD = 0.29) from 77 countries/territories. Results of multilevel mixture regression analysis indicated that reading strategies (in our case, understanding and memorizing strategies) are related to mathematics learning through reading proficiency and this relation fluctuates like the IRC. Implications for applying IRC to reading strategies instruction in mathematics education are discussed.

article,LORE2024105149,"Using computational methods to produce and interpret multiple scientific representations is now a common practice in many science disciplines. Research has shown students have difficulty in moving across, connecting, and sensemaking from multiple representations. There is a need to develop task-specific representational competencies for students to reason and conduct scientific investigations using multiple representations. In this study, we focus on three representational competencies: 1) linking between representations, 2) disciplinary sensemaking from multiple representations, and 3) conceptualizing domain-relevant content derived from multiple representations. We developed a block code-based computational modeling environment with three different representations and embedded it within an online activity for students to carry out investigations around the earthquake cycle. The three representations include a procedural representation of block codes, a geometric representation of land deformation build-up, and a graphical representation of deformation build-up over time. We examined the extent of students' representational competencies and which competencies are most correlated with students’ future performance in a computationally supported geoscience investigation. Results indicate that a majority of the 431 students showed at least some form of representational competence. However, a relatively small number of students showed sophisticated levels of linking, sensemaking, and conceptualizing from the representations. Five of seven representational competencies, the most prominent being code sensemaking (η2 = 0.053, p < 0.001), were significantly correlated to student performance on a summative geoscience investigation.",,Christopher Lore and Hee-Sun Lee and Amy Pallant and Jie Chao,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2024.105149,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"Teaching/learning strategies, Simulations, Pedagogical issues, Applications in subject areas",,105149,,"Using multiple, dynamically linked representations to develop representational competency and conceptual understanding of the earthquake cycle",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131524001635,222.0,2024,,
article,ISMAILOVA2021324,"We argue that that the use of the Carnap - Bar-Hillel principle of indexed expressions provides a suitable cognitive model to undergo the spread of information processes in the Semantic Net. To understand the stratification of the net into the surface Web and the hidden Web, a model structure is proposed that provides navigation through the net as a whole. For logical expressions, a relativized evaluation map is given, which is parameterized by the indexing system. It is allowed to use concepts that are generated using partial functions, the variables of which run over the range of possible individual information processes. A generalized operator providing virtualization is presented for individuals. The process is accompanied with the dynamic generation of Web-pages, which triggers their indexing. This way they are thereby transferred to the surface layer of the network.

article,VERDUGOCASTRO2022e10300,"The development of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) requires more qualified professionals in these fields. However, gender segregation in higher education in this sector is creating a gender gap that means that for some disciplines female representation does not even reach 30% of the total. In order to propose measures to address the phenomenon, it is necessary to understand the possible causes of this issue. A systematic literature review and mapping were carried out for the study, following the PRISMA guidelines and flowchart. The research questions to be answered were (RQ1) What studies exist on the gender gap in relation to the choice of higher education in the STEM field; and (RQ2) How do gender roles and stereotypes influence decision-making related to higher education? The review of peer-reviewed scientific articles, conferences texts, books and book chapters on the European education area was applied. A total of 4571 initial results were obtained and, after the process marked by the PRISMA flowchart, the final results were reduced to 26. The results revealed that gender stereotypes are strong drivers of the gender gap in general, and the Leaky Pipeline and Stereotype Threat in particular.

Accordingly, in this study, during one academic semester period, the Introduction to Programming course for engineering students is enriched up to a certain level through real-life game development projects with Scratch. The students are followed within a four-year period starting from freshman until their graduation. The progress of the students who have taken the Introduction to Programming course in enriched or classical form in the fourth year Senior-project course are evaluated. The results show that by slightly improving the course curriculum through real-life game development projects in the Scratch environment, students’ performance on the graduation projects improved significantly.

article,FUNDI2024100412,"With the advancement of technology, emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) have also been growing rapidly and becoming more common than ever before. Kenya has taken tremendous steps in adopting the use of emerging technology in different sectors of the economy. In realization of the need to have a skilled digital workforce to develop solutions using these emerging technologies, Kenya has undertaken curriculum reforms and introduced the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) which has included digital literacy and coding in elementary school. Furthermore, computer science has been introduced in Junior Secondary School. In view of these changes, teachers should be adequately prepared with knowledge, skills, and attitudes to effectively teach these new technologies. However, in Kenya, AI was not and still is not part of the teacher training curriculum. Additionally, there are inadequate professional development opportunities in AI for both pre-service and in-service teachers since AI is not part of the CBC curriculum. That notwithstanding, it is inevitable for teachers in the current world to introduce AI to learners. Therefore, this study's objectives were to assess the confidence in AI, attitudes toward AI, AI ethics, subjective norms, perceived threats, and the readiness to teach AI among Kenyan K-12 in-service teachers and to assess how these factors influence their readiness to teach AI. To achieve these objectives, this study employed a quantitative research methodology by administering a survey using Google Forms to a random sample of 308 teachers from different grades from 37 out of 47 counties in Kenya. The findings showed that confidence in AI, AI ethics and subjective norms significantly influenced AI readiness while attitude towards AI and perceived threats did not significantly influence AI readiness.

article,PARTHASARATHY2021121104,"This paper argues that, while universities have a crucial role to play in social innovation by democratizing knowledge, fulfilling that role in the Global South requires them to partner with civil society actors such as NGOs.

Similarly, NGOs can fill the “institutional voids” which limit socioeconomic transactions in the Global South. The paper discusses the wicked nature of visual-impairment, which is both widely prevalent and has biopsychosocial attributes i.e., the functional limitations are reinforced by the psychological perceptions of the blind and visually impaired (BVI), and the sociological stigma of impairment. The empirical setting is India where policies for the BVI population are being formulated within a broader framework of social inclusion.

article,RICHARDSON2022880,"Summary
The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant escapes neutralizing antibodies elicited by vaccines or infection. However, whether Omicron triggers cross-reactive humoral responses to other variants of concern (VOCs) remains unknown. We used plasma from 20 unvaccinated and 7 vaccinated individuals infected by Omicron BA.1 to test binding, Fc effector function, and neutralization against VOCs. In unvaccinated individuals, Fc effector function and binding antibodies targeted Omicron and other VOCs at comparable levels. However, Omicron BA.1-triggered neutralization was not extensively cross-reactive for VOCs (14- to 31-fold titer reduction), and we observed 4-fold decreased titers against Omicron BA.2. In contrast, vaccination followed by breakthrough Omicron infection associated with improved cross-neutralization of VOCs with titers exceeding 1:2,100. This has important implications for the vulnerability of unvaccinated Omicron-infected individuals to reinfection by circulating and emerging VOCs.

This study contributes to the empirical literature on students' use of AI chatbots and how they influence learning. The aim of this study is to identify how to adapt programming education in higher engineering education. A mixed-methods case study was conducted of a scientific computing course in a Mechanical Engineering Master's program at a Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. Data consisted of 29 student questionnaires, a semi-structured group interview with three students, a semi-structured interview with the teacher, and 29 students' grades. Results show that students used ChatGPT for error checking and debugging of code, increasing conceptual understanding, generating, and optimizing solution code, explaining code, and solving mathematical problems. While students reported advantages of using ChatGPT, the teacher expressed concerns over declining code quality and student learning. Furthermore, both students and teacher perceived a negative influence from ChatGPT usage on pair programming, and consequently on student collaboration. The findings suggest that learning objectives should be formulated in more detail, to highlight essential programming skills, and be expanded to include the use of AI tools.

article,PAPAVLASOPOULOU201757,"The Maker Movement has gathered much attention recently, and has been one of the fastest-growing topics, due to contemporary technical and infrastructural developments. The maker culture can be described as a philosophy in which individuals or groups of individuals create artifacts that are recreated and assembled using software and/or physical objects. Typical topics of interest in maker culture include engineering-oriented pursuits such as electronics, robotics, 3D printing, and computer numerical control tools, as well as more traditional activities such as sewing or arts and crafts. Scholars and educators have reported a variety of outcomes from the Maker Movement as an instructional process; however, the lack of a summary of these empirical studies prevents stakeholders from having a clear view of the benefits and challenges of this instructional culture. The purpose of this article is to provide a review of the Maker Movement approach in order to summarize the current findings and guide future studies. Forty-three peer-reviewed articles were collected from a systematic literature search and analyzed based on a categorization of their main elements. The results of this survey show the direction of Maker Movement research during recent years and the most common technologies, subjects, evaluation methods, and pedagogical designs. Suggestions for future research include a further investigation into the benefits of using a specific technological tool and analysis of the Maker Movement approach, particularly in classrooms.

article,WEI2021104097,"This systematic review on massive open online courses (MOOCs) in higher education examined the research on the assessment of learning outcomes based on 65 peer-reviewed articles published between 2017 and 2019. This study aims to investigate the learning outcomes, related instruments, and assessment characteristics of these instruments in MOOCs. Learning outcomes that were examined in the studies that were reviewed concerned cognitive, behavioral, and affective learning outcomes. Twenty-five types of assessment approaches were employed to examine these outcomes and to identify the assessment characteristics. The results indicate that a consideration of the assessment of learning outcomes at the beginning of course design could support the formulation of explicit assessment goals and, in this way, instruct learners to work toward learning outcomes. A combination of knowledge tests and skill tasks can be used to examine cognitive outcomes in a particular MOOC. Outcome-oriented feedback rubrics are beneficial to support learner essay performance and interpretations of the utilization of rubrics could better guide providers to give peer feedback. A variety of behavioral and affective outcomes reflect multiple aspects of participant learning in MOOCs, which might contribute to better understanding by teachers and the provision of learning support. Furthermore, assessment tasks throughout the course may differ in difficulty and complexity, which could align with different levels of learner motivation. The findings provide a holistic picture of learning outcomes and related assessment instruments in current MOOCs. Curriculum designers and teachers could benefit from this study to consider appropriate learning outcome variables and instruments to apply in their MOOC practices. Future research might investigate the motivation of learners to participate in a MOOC and how this changes during a MOOC.

article,MOGHADDAMMOGHADDAM2020367,"Purpose
The purpose of this collaborative self-study inquiry was to enhance the professional practice of faculty members through the adoption of lesson study. A seven-member faculty of education self-study group engaged in lesson study in a computer and learning resources for primary/elementary teachers’ course with teacher candidates.
Design/methodology/approach
This study focused on providing teacher candidates with increased opportunities for action and expression during in-class instruction. This collaborative lesson study inquiry (Fernandez et al., 2003; Fernandez and Yoshida, 2004; Murata, 2011) involved the four-step process of planning, doing, checking and acting (PDCA) (Cheng, 2019). Several data collection methods were adopted and data sources analyzed.
Findings
Challenges the group encountered during the study included ascertaining the goals of lesson study and offering critical feedback to each other. While this made decision-making more intricate and intentional, there was exceptional value in participating in the lesson study process. The results revealed three overarching themes: 1) challenges in classroom observations; 2) hesitation in providing supportive feedback to colleagues and 3) deliberations regarding what constitutes expertise within subject-specific preservice teacher education.
Originality/value
While lesson study has been adopted fairly extensively in K-12 settings, its adoption in postsecondary education is limited (Chenault, 2017). Considering the merits of lesson study for K-12 practitioners, this research investigated the similar advantages that lesson study might have for postsecondary education faculty, students and programs.",,AlirezaAlireza MoghaddamMoghaddam and ChristineChristine ArnoldArnold and SaiqaSaiqa AzamAzam and KarenKaren GoodnoughGoodnough and KimberlyKimberly MaichMaich and SharonSharon PenneyPenney and GabrielleGabrielle YoungYoung,,https://doi.org/10.1108/IJLLS-05-2020-0025,,,,2046-8253,International Journal for Lesson and Learning Studies,"Lesson study, Self-study, Universal design for learning, Education, Pre‐service teacher education",4,367-381,,Exploring lesson study in postsecondary education through self-study,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2046825320000207,9.0,2020,,
article,YANG2021104057,"This study began with concerns about mis-/disinformation in the new media environment as we sought ways to combat unreliable information. We developed an online educational game designed to enhance core media and information literacy competencies and to help young adults become information literate citizens. We examined the game's effects on skepticism toward online information and information discernment skills, two of the most important MIL competencies. In an online experiment, a total of 210 participants between 20 and 29 years of age were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the game group that played the developed online game, the quiz group that completed a quiz with no game element, and the control group that did not receive any treatment. Before treatment, the participants' perceived levels of intellectual civic skills were measured with a pre-questionnaire. After treatment, skepticism toward online information and information discernment skills as learning outcomes were measured with survey items on skepticism toward online information and an information discernment skills test, respectively. The results showed that the game effectively enhanced the cognitive aspect of media and information literacy (information discernment skills), but not the attitudinal aspect (skepticism toward online information). In addition, the game was found to be effective regardless of the participant's perceived level of intellectual civic skills, while quiz with no game element was found to be effective only when the participant's perceived level of intellectual civic skills was high. These findings demonstrate the importance of digital game-based intervention as an educational resource.

Contrary to the four-dimensional Gauss–Bonnet theory, where the Gauss–Bonnet term does not contribute to the field equations, in this five-dimensional Einstein–Scalar–Gauss–Bonnet model, the Gauss–Bonnet term contributes to the field equations even when the coupling function is a constant. Additionally, we consider a more general coupling described by a power-law function. For the scalar field potential, we consider the exponential function. For each choice of the coupling function, we define a set of dimensionless variables and write the field equations into a system of ordinary differential equations. We perform a detailed analysis of the dynamics for both systems and classify the stability of the equilibrium points.

article,CACEFFO2022104324,"New ubiquitous technologies and interaction paradigms can play a key role in facilitating social interaction processes among children. A class of systems named “enactive” aims to support fluid interaction between technology and people via feedback cycles — the effect of technology on the human agent is fed back by the human action on the technology — based on the use of data sensors. We have extended this concept in a long-term project on socioenactive systems, by emphasizing social aspects in the enactive phenomena. In this article, we investigate how a robot-based experience can promote social behavior among children in an educational context. The study was conducted in workshops with 26 children (4–5 years old), organized in two groups. The system scenario used a narrative based on an adaptation of the Little Red Riding Hood tale to investigate children's interaction in playing embodied-based situations. Data captured from video-recorded workshop sessions were analyzed post hoc using the Grounded Theory methods. In total, 26 interaction coding were identified, with a high interrater reliability assessed by Cohen's Kappa (k = 0.84). Our findings indicate that 50.5% of the children's actions were the result of children-children and group-robot interactions, compared to the 38% of children interacting individually with the robot. This indicates children's high degree of embodied peer collaboration and initiative to accomplish the tasks in the proposed scenario.

Self-determination theory (SDT) can explain student engagement from the needs satisfaction perspective. Therefore, this project aimed to investigate how SDT-based needs support by teachers and student attributes (gender and achievement level) affect AI learning at secondary school level. It adopted a two-study design, with each study using a 2 × 2 between-subjects factorial design with student needs support from teachers as one factor and one of the student attributes as the other: gender in Study 1 and achievement level in Study 2. In both studies, there were two groups – SDT-based (teacher needs support) and control (without). The analyses revealed that in the SDT-based program, (1) the students had a more positive perception of AI learning and felt that their needs were satisfied, and (2) there were non-significant differences in AI learning between boys and girls and between high and low achievers. The findings suggest that a focus on needs satisfaction could engage boys and girls, and high and low achievers in AI learning.

article,MAHOMED2023e230,"Summary
Background
Young women in sub-Saharan Africa continue to bear a high burden of HIV infection. Combination anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies are a potential HIV prevention technology that could overcome adherence challenges of daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis. In this phase 1 clinical trial we aimed to determine the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of the broadly neutralising monoclonal antibody CAP256V2LS.
Methods
CAPRISA 012B, a first-in-human dose-escalation phase 1 trial evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and neutralisation activity of CAP256V2LS alone and in combination with VRC07-523LS in young HIV-negative women in Durban, South Africa. Groups 1 and 2 were open label with CAP256V2LS administered at 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg intravenously and 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg subcutaneously. In group 3, participants were randomly allocated to receive a combination of CAP256V2LS and VRC07-523LS at 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg subcutaneously comixed with ENHANZE, a recombinant human hyaluronidase. Once safety was established in the first three participants, dose escalation took place sequentially following review of safety data. Primary endpoints were the proportion of participants with mild, moderate, and severe reactogenicity or adverse events, graded as per the Division of AIDS toxicity grading. The trial is registered on the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, PACTR202003767867253, and is recruiting.
Findings
From July 13, 2020, to Jan 13, 2021, 42 HIV-negative women, aged 18–45 years, were enrolled. All 42 participants, eight with intravenous and 34 with subcutaneous administration, completed the trial. There were no serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities. Most commonly reported symptoms following intravenous administration were headaches in seven (88%) and nausea in four (50%) participants. Commonly reported symptoms following subcutaneous administration were headache in 31 (91%), chills in 25 (74%), and malaise or fatigue in 19 (56%) participants. Adverse events included transient lymphocytopenia in eight (19%), proteinuria in nine (21%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase in ten (24%), and alanine aminotransferase in five (12%) participants.
Interpretation
CAP256V2LS administered alone and in combination with VRC07-523LS was safe with favourable pharmacokinetics and neutralisation activity, supporting further assessment in larger clinical studies.

article,CHELLAPPA2024100281,"The benefits of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled language models, such as ChatGPT, have contributed to their growing popularity in education. However, there is currently a lack of evidence regarding the perception of ChatGPT, specifically among design students. This study aimed to understand the product design (PD) and user experience design (UXD) students' views on ChatGPT and focused on an Indian university. The study employed a survey research design, utilizing questionnaires as the primary data collection method. The collected data (n = 149) was analyzed using descriptive statistics (i.e., frequency, percentage, average, and standard deviation (SD). Inferential statistics (i.e., one-way ANOVA) was used to understand the significant differences between the programs of study, gender, and academic level. The findings indicate that the students expressed admiration for the capabilities of ChatGPT and found it to be an interesting and helpful tool for their studies. In addition, the students' motivation towards using ChatGPT was moderate. Furthermore, the study observed significant differences between PD and UXD students and differences based on gender and academic level on certain variables.

Drawing on concepts of teacher agency and learner agency, and viewed through a figurational sociology lens, this paper explored the realities of teaching LCCS and the role teacher agency and learner agency played in such enactment. Through a case study design, four teachers were interviewed in a focus group semi-structured manner. To delve deeper into the pedagogical approaches used in LCCS, a further one teacher and their nine students were interviewed. The findings highlight an influential relationship (positive and negative, encouraging and discouraging) between teachers’ agentic decisions in their process of achieving teacher agency and the students process of achieving learner agency. The paper offers a figurational viewpoint of the relationship between teacher agency and learner agency through a constructed Figure.

article,YUCEL2019352,"Abstract.
Gender has been consistently controlled as a variable in usability and playability tests. However, there is no consensus on whether and how gender differences should influence the design of digital environments. According to some research, digital environments may be unintentionally designed especially for males as a result of the existing gender biases which risks reproducing gender-polarized culture in a computational field. This study attempts to highlight that females are still being negatively affected by existing gender stereotypes and prescribed gender identities despite relatively equal access and use of computer technology. This qualitative study aims to provide insights about the first-time user experience in a home environment of 16 middle school children in Turkey (8 males - 8 females), aged between 11 and 14 years, with a code learning game named “Code Combat”. The analysis is supported with complementary quantitative findings. The present study investigates the participants' conceptualizations and opinions toward coding concept and this specific coding game. Further, it explores how existing gender stereotypes and gender biased expectations impact their behaviors and attitudes in the context of game experience. Our results indicated that perceived computer competence and perceived coding difficulty had important effects on the participants’ performance relatedly with their gender identity. According to our findings, there are important gender differences to be found in our 9 constructs, namely; perceived computer competence, perceived coding difficulty, identification, perceived game difficulty, perceived success, level of enjoyment, level of anxiety, the likelihood of playing it another time and the likelihood of trying new features.",,Yeliz Yücel and Kerem Rızvanoğlu,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2019.05.029,,,,0747-5632,Computers in Human Behavior,"User experience (UX), Digital gender divide, Gender stereotypes, Stereotype threat, Games, Serious games",,352-365,,"Battling gender stereotypes: A user study of a code-learning game, “Code Combat,” with middle school children",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563219302109,99.0,2019,,

article,HANAUER20171,"Objective
The utility of biomedical information retrieval environments can be severely limited when users lack expertise in constructing effective search queries. To address this issue, we developed a computer-based query recommendation algorithm that suggests semantically interchangeable terms based on an initial user-entered query. In this study, we assessed the value of this approach, which has broad applicability in biomedical information retrieval, by demonstrating its application as part of a search engine that facilitates retrieval of information from electronic health records (EHRs).
Materials and Methods
The query recommendation algorithm utilizes MetaMap to identify medical concepts from search queries and indexed EHR documents. Synonym variants from UMLS are used to expand the concepts along with a synonym set curated from historical EHR search logs. The empirical study involved 33 clinicians and staff who evaluated the system through a set of simulated EHR search tasks. User acceptance was assessed using the widely used technology acceptance model.
Results
The search engine’s performance was rated consistently higher with the query recommendation feature turned on vs. off. The relevance of computer-recommended search terms was also rated high, and in most cases the participants had not thought of these terms on their own. The questions on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use received overwhelmingly positive responses. A vast majority of the participants wanted the query recommendation feature to be available to assist in their day-to-day EHR search tasks.
Discussion and Conclusion
Challenges persist for users to construct effective search queries when retrieving information from biomedical documents including those from EHRs. This study demonstrates that semantically-based query recommendation is a viable solution to addressing this challenge.",,David A. Hanauer and Danny T.Y.

Studying the multifractal characteristics of the TBM operational parameters can help identify the patterns, but the relevant research has not yet been explored. This paper proposed a novel classification model for quality grades of surrounding rock in TBM tunnels based on multifractal analysis theory. Initially, the statistical characteristics of eight TBM cycle data with different grades of surrounding rock were explored. Subsequently, the method of calculating and analyzing the multifractal characteristic parameters of the TBM operational data was deduced and summarized. The research results showed that the TBM operational parameters of cutterhead torque, total thrust, advance rate, and cutterhead rotation speed have significant multifractal characteristics. Its multifractal dimension, midpoint slope of the generalized fractal spectrum, and singularity strength range can be used to evaluate the surrounding rock grades of the tunnel. Finally, a novel classification model for the tunnel surrounding rocks based on the multifractal characteristic parameters was proposed using the multiple linear regression method, and the model was verified through four TBM cycle data containing different surrounding rock grades. The results showed that the proposed multifractal-based classification model for tunnel surrounding rocks has high accuracy and applicability.

article,VANMECHELEN2019179,"This paper presents the Collaborative Design Thinking (CoDeT) co-design approach, its theoretical framework, and its application in a case study with 49 children aged 9 to 10 in two schools. CoDeT aims to scaffold children's collaboration and design thinking in co-design settings characterised by a high child-to-adult ratio (ca. 1 adult for 15 to 20 children), such as schools, museums and maker spaces. In these settings, children have to work relatively independent from adults who become guides on the side. This can be challenging due to children's limited understanding of the design process and their lack of skills to collaborate productively towards a shared design goal. CoDeT addresses these challenges by integrating principles of Social Interdependence Theory (SIT) and Design Thinking (DT), which together form the theoretical backbone of the approach.

article,SHAHID2022100340,"This paper presents a systematic literature review on technology-enhanced support for children with Down Syndrome and young people who match the mental age of children considered neurotypical (NT). The main aim is threefold: to (1) explore the field of digital technologies designed to support children with Down Syndrome, (2) identify technology types, contexts of use, profiles of individuals with Down Syndrome, methodological approaches, and the effectiveness of such supports, and (3) draw out opportunities for future research in this specific area. A systematic literature review was conducted on five search engines resulting in a set of 703 articles, which were screened and filtered in a systematic way until they were narrowed to a corpus of 65 articles for further analysis. The synthesis identify several key findings: (1) there is diversity of technology supports available for children with Down Syndrome targeting individual capabilities, (2) overlapping definitions of technology makes it difficult to place technology supports in individual categories rather than subsets of a broader term, (3) the average sample size remained small for participants in the studies, making it difficult to draw solid conclusions on the effectiveness of the related interventions, (4) the distribution of papers indicates that this is an emerging area of research and is starting to build body of knowledge, and (5) there are limited studies on newer emerging technologies which requires further investigation to explore their potential.",,Numera M.I.

article,HUBNER2023104847,"Information and communication technology (ICT) literacy is key to solving future societal challenges and to leading an independent and responsible life in an increasingly globalized and digitalized world. Hence, countries around the world have promoted research on students' ICT skills and their inclusion in curricula. Despite these efforts, little is known about what predicts future ICT literacy, and prior research has almost exclusively conducted cross-sectional studies. In the present study, we addressed this gap by using data from a large-scale longitudinal study of 6810 students in 311 schools from Germany. These students participated in the National Educational Panel Study over the course of secondary school (in Grades 6, 9, and 12). We were particularly interested in investigating potential spillover effects from skills and dispositions that are inherently fostered in school on ICT development. Thus, we considered a rich set of different types of predictors related to the students' social, cultural, demographic, and learning backgrounds; their subject-specific motivation; and the composition of their schools, and we assessed the extent to which these variables explained variation in ICT literacy development at two key stages in the educational system (Grades 9 and 12). Our results indicated that prior ICT literacy was the most important predictor of future ICT literacy but more so for the development between Grades 9 and 12. In addition, variables related to the students' learning backgrounds, followed by variables related to the composition of their schools and students' subject-specific motivation explained future ICT literacy. Overall, the predictors explained between 49% and 67% of the variation in future ICT literacy. Our longitudinal findings suggest that the learning environment and students’ skills and dispositions are crucial for understanding ICT development and are indicative of the deliberate design of ICT interventions.",,Nicolas Hübner and Thorsten Fahrbach and Andreas Lachner and Ronny Scherer,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2023.104847,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"Information and communication technology (ICT) literacy, Longitudinal data, Digital sills, National Educational Panel Study (NEPS)",,104847,,What predicts students’ future ICT literacy?

Although previous reviews have examined the impact of PAs on learning and learning-related outcomes, it still remains unclear what specific design features, social cues, and other contextual elements of PA implementation can optimize the learning process. These questions are even more prevalent with regards to the K-12 population, as most reviews to date have largely focused on post-secondary learners. To address this gap in the literature, we systematically review empirical studies around the design of PAs for K-12 learners. After reviewing 1374 studies for potential inclusion, we analyzed 44 studies that met our inclusion criteria using Heidig and Clarebout's (2011) frameworks. Our findings showed that learners had preferences for specific types of PAs. While these preferences were not always associated with increased learning outcomes, there is a lack of research specifically investigating the intersection of perceptions and learning.

article,BORSATTO2024100160,"Purpose
Considering the role of community outreach of a Higher Education Institution (HEI) in promoting sustainable regional development, based on the objectives of the UN 2030 Agenda, the present study aims to verify, with the usage of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool, the alignment of community outreach actions of an HEI to the SDGs and identify its actions with the greatest impact.
Design/methodology/approach
The study is descriptive through a case study at a university in Brazil. Documentary analysis was carried out using data on more than 15,000 community outreach projects developed from 2009 to 2022, using natural language processing (NLP). In addition to the descriptive aspects, combining NLP with statistical techniques allowed us to discuss the alignment between community outreach projects and the SDGs from a longitudinal perspective.
Findings
The results demonstrated that the main SDGs in community outreach actions are SDG 17: Partnerships and Means of Implementation; SDG 4: Quality Education; SDG 12: Sustainable Consumption and Production and SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. These results are prominent because community outreach aims to establish a dialogical relationship between society and the university, conceiving the exchange of knowledge based on the actions developed and sharing knowledge with those involved in community extension.

article,SINGH2023e1372,"Summary
Background
The convergence of infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases in South Africa is challenging to health systems. In this analysis, we assessed the multimorbidity health needs of individuals and communities in rural KwaZulu-Natal and established a framework to quantify met and unmet health needs for individuals living with infectious and non-communicable diseases.
Methods
We analysed data collected between May 25, 2018, and March 13, 2020, from participants of a large, community-based, cross-sectional multimorbidity survey (Vukuzazi) that offered community-based HIV, hypertension, and diabetes screening to all residents aged 15 years or older in a surveillance area in the uMkhanyakude district in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Data from the Vukuzazi survey were linked with data from demographic and health surveillance surveys with a unique identifier common to both studies. Questionnaires were used to assess the diagnosed health conditions, treatment history, general health, and sociodemographic characteristics of an individual. For each condition (ie, HIV, hypertension, and diabetes), individuals were defined as having no health needs (absence of condition), met health needs (condition that is well controlled), or one or more unmet health needs (including diagnosis, engagement in care, or treatment optimisation). We analysed met and unmet health needs for individual and combined conditions and investigated their geospatial distribution.
Findings
Of 18 041 participants who completed the survey (12 229 [67·8%] were female and 5812 [32·2%] were male), 9898 (54·9%) had at least one of the three chronic diseases measured. 4942 (49·9%) of these 9898 individuals had at least one unmet health need (1802 [18·2%] of 9898 needed treatment optimisation, 1282 [13·0%] needed engagement in care, and 1858 [18·8%] needed a diagnosis). Unmet health needs varied by disease; 1617 (93·1%) of 1737 people who screened positive for diabetes, 2681 (58·2%) of 4603 people who screened positive for hypertension, and 1321 (21·7%) of 6096 people who screened positive for HIV had unmet health needs. Geospatially, met health needs for HIV were widely distributed and unmet health needs for all three conditions had specific sites of concentration; all three conditions had an overlapping geographical pattern for the need for diagnosis.
Interpretation
Although people living with HIV predominantly have a well controlled condition, there is a high burden of unmet health needs for people living with hypertension and diabetes. In South Africa, adapting current, widely available HIV care services to integrate non-communicable disease care is of high priority.

article,SUAZOHERNANDEZ2023139836,"Zero–valent copper engineered nanoparticles (Cu–ENPs) released through unintentional or intentional actions into the agricultural soils can alter the availability of inorganic phosphorus (IP) to plants. In this study, we used adsorption–desorption experiments to evaluate the effect of particle size of 1% Cu–ENPs (25 nm and 40–60 nm) on IP availability in Santa Barbara (SB) volcanic ash soil. X–Ray Diffraction results showed that Cu–ENPs were formed by a mixture of Cu metallic and Cu oxides (Cu2O or/and CuO) species, while specific surface area values showed that Cu–ENPs/25 nm could form larger aggregate particles compared to Cu–ENPs/40–60 nm. The kinetic IP adsorption of SB soil without and with 1% Cu–ENPs (25 nm and 40–60 nm) followed the mechanism described by the pseudo–second–order (k2 = 0.45–1.13 x 10−3 kg mmol−1 min−1; r2 ≥ 0.999, and RSS ≤ 0.091) and Elovich (α = 14621.10–3136.20 mmol kg−1 min−1; r2 ≥ 0.984, and RSS ≤ 69) models. Thus, the rate–limiting step for IP adsorption in the studied systems was chemisorption on a heterogeneous surface. Adsorption equilibrium isotherms without Cu–ENPs were fitted well to the Freundlich model, while with 1% Cu–ENPs (25 nm and 40–60 nm), isotherms were described best by the Freundlich and/or Langmuir model. The IP relative adsorption capacity (KF) was higher with 1% Cu–ENPs/40–60 nm (KF = 110.41) than for 1% Cu–ENPs/25 nm (KF = 74.40) and for SB soil (KF = 48.17). This study showed that plausible IP retention mechanisms in the presence of 1% Cu–ENPs in SB soil were: i) ligand exchange, ii) electrostatic attraction, and iii) co–precipitate formation. The desorption study demonstrated that 1% Cu–ENPs/40–60 nm increased the affinity of IP in SB soil with a greater effect than 1% Cu–ENPs/25 nm.

article,MORCH2023100697,"This article addresses the opportunities and challenges of turning a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classroom into a makerspace for hands-on experimentation with digital tools and materials in science education. In this qualitative case study, over a period of 16 weeks, video data were collected during making activities in an advanced placement science course with 19 pupils aged 12–16 years, and interviews were conducted. We combined thematic and interaction analyses of empirical data and identified three themes: 1) engagement and spontaneous concepts, 2) programming and making physical objects, and 3) subject integration. Our conceptual framework for the analyses integrated two features of the Vygotskian sociocultural theory of learning: concept development as a dialectical process of scientific and everyday concepts and the “tool and symbol” duality. Our findings show that both top-down and bottom-up approaches to integrating school subjects into a makerspace were effective but underused.

article,ALYASIN2022170047,"Deep learning methods and applications assist geologists in predicting and identifying lithologies in different surveys, hence lowering operational costs and uptime. This allows accurate data analysis and completion of scientific research on data obtained at geologically different places. This study used 4 lithologies datasets with high dimensionality and multiclass imbalance problems for analysis and classification. The imbalance of data classification is one of the most important problems facing current data analysis. Data imbalance can considerably influence classification performance, especially when dealing with other difficulty variables such as the presence of overlapping class distributions. This impact is especially obvious in multi-class conditions when mutual imbalance relations across classes complicate matters even further. Moreover, the problem of high dimensionality can lead to increased computing complexity and overfitting, and thus these issues can affect classification performance. To overcome these problems, we developed a new hybrid deep learning multi-class imbalanced learning method that combines Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE) to resample the data, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most useful predictive features. Finally, we believe that our developments can help improve geology research by providing accurate classification and rapid answers about interpreting data obtained in various study areas.",,Eman Ibrahim Alyasin and Oguz Ata and Hayder Mohammedqasim,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijleo.2022.170047,,,,0030-4026,Optik,"Lithology, Feature selection, Hyperparameters optimization, Synthetic minority oversampling technique, Multi-class imbalanced learning",,170047,,Novel hybrid classification model for multi-class imbalanced lithology dataset,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030402622013055,270.0,2022,,

Computational researchers are now becoming more independent and taking leadership roles within biomedical projects, leveraging the increased availability of public data. We are now able to generate vast amounts of data, and the challenge has shifted from data generation to data analysis. Here we discuss the pitfalls, challenges, and opportunities facing the field of data-centric research in biology. We discuss the evolving perception of computational data-driven research and its rise as an independent domain in biomedical research while also addressing the significant collaborative opportunities that arise from integrating computational research with experimental and translational biology.

This study adopted a quasi-experimental design and recruited 98 fifth graders as participants. Three groups, named the high interactive AR, low interactive AR, and the traditional learning (control) groups, were formed. The results revealed that the AR-based instruction, especially the high interactive AR mode, helped the students improve their programming achievements, gain higher learning motivation, reduce their cognitive load, and acquire a high degree of technology acceptance. The interview data mainly showed that the students in the high interactive group attained more positive experiences of assembling puzzle cards to learn programming.

article,VALCARCEDEVEER2021160,"Purpose
In a socio-educational context impregnated by social networks, feminist organizations and individuals have turned to social media to spread their knowledge. This paper aims to approach how feminist tweets are produced to ignite meaningful informal learning (IL) processes.
Design/methodology/approach
This study uses an interdisciplinary mixed methodology. By using Twitter tracking tools, a database has been enabled to catalogue feminist hashtags into topics and categories for further analysis. These data have been contrasted with surveys to the managers of the most followed feminist accounts in Spain and Catalonia.
Findings
From an educational perspective, the analysed feminist hashtags have been organized in 13 different topic categories. The different propagation processes on Twitter – tweeting and retweeting – imply diverse learning processes. Moreover, tweets with complementary information such as images or links generate the most interaction, being the preferred format for IL.
Research limitations/implications
Researching with Big Data in educational sciences is a field in development, and Twitter data collection tools are mostly addressed to marketing and economic sectors; thus, free tools with limited services were used, offering the analysis of a brief and concrete situation of a platform in constant change. Although this ephemeral data and its relevance does not prevail over time, it has an impact on citizens’ learning.

article,SZCZUKA2022100460,"Voice assistants (VAs) are available in the family context and are easy to interact with. Due to the opaqueness of these assistants, however, children in particular might be unaware of potential negative consequences (e.g., with regard to privacy). To gain a deeper understanding of children’s knowledge about VAs, of how to facilitate knowledge regarding VA technology (focusing here on parental interventions), and of how children’s knowledge and understanding affects their communicative behavior towards VAs (focusing here on telling a secret to the VA), we conducted a longitudinal field study with 16 families (N=20 children). The emphasis was on differentiating between how VAs store and process data, as both aspects are important for a sophisticated usage but vary in how they are experienced or understood. The qualitative data demonstrated that children draw observable inferences from VAs’ behavior, which explains why children know more about how data is processed than about how it is stored or accessed. Our results indicate that parental interventions positively affect children’s understanding of data processing, but that this cannot be transferred to data storage, indicating the need for self-explaining systems. Lastly, knowledge about how data is stored negatively predicts the willingness to entrust a secret to the system, which underlines the importance of a basic understanding of how technologies work, also for younger users.",,Jessica M.

article,OKONKWO2023191,"Novice programmers struggle to comprehend specific programming constructs such as arrays, recursion, and loops. One way to address this challenge is to provide practice problems for students in these topics that are considered difficult to comprehend — such as nested loops. It is proven that practice aids program comprehension, hence, since it is time consuming to manually create many practice problems; synthesising these problems is an Expert Artificial Intelligence Task that is worth investigating. In this paper we present the synthesis of nested loop exercises in Python for practice using a context-free grammar. We defined the grammar rules for modeling program templates. Algorithms were designed and implemented for the generation of structurally different nested loop exercises based on the defined production rules of the context-free grammar. Each program generated consists of two or more looping statements, with a nesting, and the context-free grammar rules also allow for the spawning of infinitely many sub-loops for every loop. We checked for the correctness of the synthesised nested loop programs with an experimental procedure of iteratively supplying these programs to the Python interpreter. The first 120,000 iterations returned no syntactic bugs, hence, showing that these programs do compile and have outputs. Furthermore, an evaluation of the programs was carried out in a survey with 210 participants (novice and expert programmers). The results of the evaluation show that over 82% of the participants agreed that the synthesised exercises were correctly generated, solvable and can be used as practice exercises for novice programmers in introductory programming modules. 120,000 iterations of synthesised loop programs can be found at: https://tinyurl.com/nestedloops2021.",,Chinedu Wilfred Okonkwo and Abejide Ade-Ibijola,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eij.2023.03.001,,,,1110-8665,Egyptian Informatics Journal,"Novice programmer, Nested loop exercises, Practice problems, Introductory programming, Context-free grammars, Procedural content generation",2,191-203,,Synthesis of nested loop exercises for practice in introductory programming,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110866523000166,24.0,2023,,

article,TANKSLEY202436,"Purpose
This paper aims to center the experiences of three cohorts (n = 40) of Black high school students who participated in a critical race technology course that exposed anti-blackness as the organizing logic and default setting of digital and artificially intelligent technology. This paper centers the voices, experiences and technological innovations of the students, and in doing so, introduces a new type of digital literacy: critical race algorithmic literacy.
Design/methodology/approach
Data for this study include student interviews (called “talk backs”), journal reflections and final technology presentations.
Findings
Broadly, the data suggests that critical race algorithmic literacies prepare Black students to critically read the algorithmic word (e.g. data, code, machine learning models, etc.) so that they can not only resist and survive, but also rebuild and reimagine the algorithmic world.
Originality/value
While critical race media literacy draws upon critical race theory in education – a theorization of race, and a critique of white supremacy and multiculturalism in schools – critical race algorithmic literacy is rooted in critical race technology theory, which is a theorization of blackness as a technology and a critique of algorithmic anti-blackness as the organizing logic of schools and AI systems.",,Tiera Chante Tanksley,,https://doi.org/10.1108/ETPC-08-2023-0102,,,,1175-8708,English Teaching: Practice & Critique,"Critical literacy, Urban education, Critical race theory, Technology and literacy, Artificial intelligence education",1,36-56,,“We’re changing the system with this one”: Black students using critical race algorithmic literacies to subvert and survive AI-mediated racism in school,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1175870824000177,23.0,2024,,

article,DAI2024101899,"Background
Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have highlighted the need to equip young students with basic AI-related knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes. However, pedagogical design for AI literacy remains a critical challenge, especially for upper elementary students aged 10–12.
Aims
This design-based study had two goals: to develop a pedagogical approach for AI literacy in upper elementary education and to empirically assess this approach through an experiment.
Sample
One hundred forty-seven sixth graders in an upper elementary school were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 75) and an experimental group (n = 72).
Methods
Following a theory-informed design convention, we proposed a dual-contrast pedagogical (DCP) approach. This approach centers on human-AI comparisons by integrating analogies and cognitive conflicts. Two teaching examples on machine learning and large language models were provided. The experimental group was taught with the DCP approach, while the control group received conventional direct instruction. Data drawn from assessment tasks and questionnaires were subjected to two-way analyses of variance and covariance.
Results
The experimental group demonstrated significantly higher performance in AI knowledge, skills, and ethical awareness. They also exhibited a significant increase in AI learning confidence and intrinsic motivation and a significant decrease in learning anxiety.
Conclusions
The DCP approach significantly improved students’ learning performance and attitudes, demonstrating its effectiveness in promoting AI literacy. This study highlights the pedagogical value of human-AI comparisons in teaching AI, while contributing to a research agenda on the cognitive and conceptual aspects of AI education.",,Yun Dai,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.learninstruc.2024.101899,,,,0959-4752,Learning and Instruction,"Artificial intelligence, AI literacy, Pedagogy, Instructional design, Human-AI comparison",,101899,,Dual-contrast pedagogy for AI literacy in upper elementary schools,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959475224000264,91.0,2024,,
article,LORSCHEID2019153,"Virtually all current major social and environmental challenges such as financial crises, migration, the erosion of democratic institutions, and the loss of biodiversity involve complex systems comprising decision-making, interacting, adaptive agents. To understand how such agent-based complex systems function and respond to change and disturbances, agent-based modeling (ABM) is increasingly recognized as the main way forward. Many motivating examples of agent-based models exist that are realistic enough to successfully support the management of complex systems, but these solutions are case-specific and contribute few general insights into the functioning of systems. General theory, though, is highly needed because we cannot model each system and question. Still, across disciplines, a critical mass of expertise has accumulated that could transform ABM into a more coherent and efficient approach to discover the functioning of complex social-economic-ecological systems.

article,GUO2024e36067,"This study aims to comprehensively analyze and evaluate the quality of college physical dance education using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models and deep learning methods. The study introduces a teaching quality evaluation (TQE) model based on one-dimensional CNN, addressing issues such as subjectivity and inconsistent evaluation criteria in traditional assessment methods. By constructing a comprehensive TQE system comprising 24 evaluation indicators, this study innovatively applies deep learning technology to quantitatively assess the quality of physical dance education. This TQE model processes one-dimensional evaluation data by extracting local features through convolutional layers, reducing dimensions via pooling layers, and feeding feature vectors into a classifier through fully connected layers to achieve an overall assessment of teaching quality. Experimental results demonstrate that after 150 iterations of training and validation on the TQE model, convergence is achieved, with mean squared error (MSE) decreasing to 0.0015 and 0.0216 on the training and validation sets, respectively. Comparatively, the TQE model exhibits significantly lower MSE on the training, validation, and test sets compared to the Back-Propagation Neural Network, accompanied by a higher R2 value, indicating superior accuracy and performance in data fitting. Further analysis on robustness, parameter sensitivity, multi-scenario adaptability, and long-term learning capabilities reveals the TQE model's strong resilience and stability in managing noisy data, varying parameter configurations, diverse teaching contexts, and extended time-series data. In practical applications, the TQE model is implemented in physical dance courses at X College to evaluate teaching quality and guide improvement strategies for instructors, resulting in notable enhancements in teaching quality and student satisfaction. In conclusion, this study offers a comprehensive evaluation of university physical dance education quality through a multidimensional assessment system and the application of the 1D-CNN model.

An important element of teachers' understanding of argumentation in science as an epistemic practice involves how they might potentially distinguish it from argumentation in other subject domains. In other words, given a broad set of subjects can be considered from an argumentation perspective (e.g., religious education, history, English), what differentiates argumentation as an epistemic practice of science? We will address this question by contrasting how argumentation is framed broadly in epistemic practices of two contrasting school subjects: science and religious education.

Three themes emerged from the findings: 1) effects of the pandemic as related to online teaching for attainment of 21st century skills, 2) elaboration of best practices for online teaching to facilitate such attainment, and 3) challenges that exist for distance learning and student acquisition of 21st century skills. Therefore, the findings suggest that elementary teachers should find opportunities for elementary students to experience distance learning as an ongoing learning solution in order to incorporate innovative strategies that enhance their 21st century skills.",,Halah {Ahmed Alismail},,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e19275,,,,2405-8440,Heliyon,"Distance learning, Elementary school students, 21st century skills, Challenges, COVID-19",9,e19275,,Teachers’ perspectives of utilizing distance learning to support 21st century skill attainment for K-3 elementary students during the COVID-19 pandemic era,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844023064836,9.0,2023,,

article,RADU2023100008,"Makerspace environments are becoming popular project-based learning spaces where students interact with physical objects and peer collaboration, while developing 21st century skills and engaging with science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) topics. At the same time, augmented reality (AR) technology, which combines physical objects with digital visualizations, is becoming increasingly applicable for makerspace activities and has potential to address challenges for student learning in makerspaces. However, there is a lack of understanding of how to use and integrate AR in real makerspace environments. In this research we use a co-design methodology to address the following questions: (1) How can AR be useful for education in makerspaces? (2) How are students impacted by the process of co-designing AR technology? and (3) What are practical considerations for integrating AR in makerspaces? We engaged in a co-design process in a semester-long makerspace course attended by 18 students in a graduate school of education. Through this process, we generated six prototypes with seven student co-designers, exploring AR use in design, fabrication, programming, electronics, and training. We also identified areas where AR technology can benefit makerspaces, such as teaching STEM skills, facilitating construction activities, enhancing contextualization of learning, and debugging. We observed that students participating in co-design demonstrated improved understanding of technology design, enthusiasm for engaging with makerspaces and AR, and increased critical thinking about AR technology.

The two co-robots are: (1) a Glider for Underwater Problem-solving and Promotion of Interest in Engineering or GUPPIE and (2) a Neurally controlled manipulator called Neu-pulator. The co-robots are easy and inexpensive to manufacture, with readily available lightweight and durable components. They are also modular to accommodate a variety of learning activities that help young students to learn crosscutting concepts and engineering practice. The early assessment results show that students’ interests in activities related to robotics depend on their perception of the difficulty and their confidence level. The key is to start early when the students are young. The challenge is to break the barriers and define tasks as fun activities with a learn and play approach that can be rewarding. In this work, using a meaningful context – as in co-robots that help humans – in a hands-on project-based program that integrates different aspect of design, science, and technology is found effective in increasing students’ enthusiasm and participation.

article,PALOMINO2023100596,"In gamification, personalization is considered an important field of research since it can improve user engagement and motivation. Particularly, effective gamified learning needs to strike a balance between gameful design that promotes engagement and does not negatively affect content comprehension and absorption. The existing traditional user-type questionnaires approaches are time-consuming and intrusive, hampering the user’s focus. Previous research in gamification demonstrated how to automate player profile creation through log file analysis of gameful systems instead of traditional approaches, however, psychological archetypes and motivational groups can simplify the process of collecting data to achieve a balanced level of personalization for gamified systems, which are grounded on the user’s profile and preferences which can help with their immersion. To attend to the needs of a wide range of fields that introduce gamification to systems that are not classified as games, a new ludic approach was created to define user types based on user interaction using symbolic images. In this exploratory research, we tested this approach in two card-sorting studies (N=35 and N=19). Our results show that the images can be used to predict the users’ archetypes and motivational groups accurately. Thus, we contribute with validating an image-based user type classification method that is easier to deploy in systems that do not aim to behave as a game but are looking to reap the benefits of personalizing a user’s content and gameful experience where relevant.

Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 evolution in specific geographies may help predict properties of the variants that come from these regions. We mapped neutralization of a SARS-CoV-2 strain that evolved over 6 months from ancestral virus in a person with advanced HIV disease in South Africa; this person was infected prior to emergence of the Beta and Delta variants. We longitudinally tracked the evolved virus and tested it against self-plasma and convalescent plasma from ancestral, Beta, and Delta infections. Early virus was similar to ancestral, but it evolved a multitude of mutations found in Omicron and other variants. It showed substantial but incomplete Pfizer BNT162b2 escape, weak neutralization by self-plasma, and despite pre-dating Delta, it also showed extensive escape of Delta infection-elicited neutralization. This example is consistent with the notion that SARS-CoV-2 evolving in individual immune-compromised hosts, including those with advanced HIV disease, may gain immune escape of vaccines and enhanced escape of Delta immunity, and this has implications for vaccine breakthrough and reinfections.",,Sandile Cele and Farina Karim and Gila Lustig and James Emmanuel San and Tandile Hermanus and Houriiyah Tegally and Jumari Snyman and Thandeka Moyo-Gwete and Eduan Wilkinson and Mallory Bernstein and Khadija Khan and Shi-Hsia Hwa and Sasha W.

article,DEMIR2023101286,"Background
Critical thinking (CT) is an important 21st-century skill which enables individuals to actively use their knowledge and problem-solving skills to overcome life challenges. Educators, employers, and policymakers focus on CT skills to foster scientific thinking in education. In many countries, the development of CT skills has become a major component in education. CT skills training is offered to students based on the assumption that every student learns these skills in the same manner (i.e., homogeneity assumption). However, if heterogenous groups exist, accounting for this may provide more effective CT skills training.
Methods
Latent profile analysis (LPA) was applied to the Cornell Critical Thinking Test (CCTT) with middle school students from South Korea (N = 520), Turkey (N = 996), and the United States (N = 1,599), separately, to determine if CT subpopulations exist for each country. Generalizability of the latent profiles across countries were investigated through a multi-group LPA similarity assessment.
Results
Employing multiple fit criteria, a three-profile solution was identified for each country, and multi-group LPA analysis supported the similarity of the profiles across countries.
Conclusion
Similar CT skill profiles across countries suggest that interventions for developing CT skills may be appropriate across educational contexts. Further work is needed to understand the mechanisms behind a student's CT profile and inform interventions or curricula for fostering CT skills. Future directions and limitations were discussed.",,Cihan Demir and Brian F.

However, further research is needed to understand how AWE is perceived by middle school students in the United States, as they have received less attention in this field. This study investigated U.S. middle school students’ perceptions of the MI Write AWE system. Students reported their perceptions of MI Write's usefulness using Likert-scale items and an open-ended survey question. We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify latent topics in students’ comments, followed by qualitative analysis to interpret the themes related to those topics. We then examined whether these themes differed among students who agreed or disagreed that MI Write was a useful learning tool. The LDA analysis revealed four latent topics: (1) students desire more in-depth feedback, (2) students desire an enhanced user experience, (3) students value MI Write as a learning tool but desire greater personalization, and (4) students desire increased fairness in automated scoring. The distribution of these topics varied based on students’ ratings of MI Write's usefulness, with Topic 1 more prevalent among students who generally did not find MI Write useful and Topic 3 more prominent among those who found MI Write useful.

article,LI2023240,"Purpose
This study explores how lesson study (LS) can promote elementary Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) teachers’ professional development (TPD) in terms of new pedagogical practices, attitudes and beliefs in the maker education (ME) context.
Design/methodology/approach
This is a case study of a LS conducted in China involving four primary school teachers, 20 grade-4 students, and one researcher who also acted as a facilitator. This study adopted an integrated model that combined the unique characteristics of Chinese LS (CLS) with the Dutch LS (LSNL) model.
Findings
This study revealed that LS participation facilitates teachers’ integration of new ME pedagogical practices in their classrooms, while their attitudes and beliefs regarding teaching and learning are increasingly aligned with ME principles. However, challenges such as time constraints, lack of research skills, and insufficient learning resources have also been identified.
Research limitations/implications
This was a small-scale study, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.
Practical implications
This study expands the use of LS in the ME context by highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing teachers’ PD in terms of new pedagogical practices, attitudes, and beliefs. It also recommends incorporating diverse international LS models to address the limitations associated with localized models of TPD.
Originality/value
The originality of this study lies in its adoption of an integrated LS model to enhance STEM teachers’ PD in an ME context.

article,FLORES201825,"This paper describes a four-year observation using a model designed and tested in a middle school maker space, called problem-based science (PbS). PbS was used as the primary model for a middle school science curriculum adapted by the tools and mindsets of the maker movement. PbS is learning through inventing and problem solving — while using the latest in fabrication technology, like 3D printers and laser cutters, as well as more traditional making skills, like electronics, robotics, sewing and carpentry. PbS is based on Seymour Papert’s constructionism, set to a science curriculum taught full time in a makerspace or fablab. Bridging ideas in design thinking, maker education, and applied math and science, the term problem-based science was used to describe how learning would look, sound, and feel different in a makerspace, when a focus was on learner-centered curriculum. The design and testing of this curriculum took place as part of the 5th and 6th grade science courses offered at a private (non-public) school in California (USA) the fall of 2012, through the spring of 2016. Through daily formative assessment, as well as exit surveys, the patterns and benefits of learning in a self-directed learning space, designed for constructionism, were observed. This paper shares the highlights of those years. Video taped exit surveys conducted by the author, show that self-direction is both challenging and rewarding, students often felt trusted and respected, even if they did not always feel supported in a manner common in a more teacher directed classroom setting. Daily informal classroom observations revealed that using student driven, open-ended problem solving, rather than a 100% teacher led, step by step lab, lends to a more diverse pool of leadership practice in students and higher engagement in hard problems. Students typically seen as struggling in traditional classrooms, identified as experts and successful learners in this setting.

article,KORDAKI2013141,"The aim of this work is threefold. Firstly, an empirical study was designed with the aim of investigating the beliefs that High School Computing (HSC) teachers hold about: (a) their motivational orientation, self-efficacy, and self-expectations as Computing teachers, (b) the nature of HSC and its curricula, (c) how their students could be better learners in Computing, and the expectations they have of their students, and (d) their own teaching approaches and the alternatives they propose for best teaching of HSC. Secondly, an empirical study was realized to investigate the same HSC teachers' classroom practices. Thirdly, possible associations between the teachers' beliefs and their teaching practices were investigated. 25 HSC teachers participated, their beliefs being elicited through structured interviews, while their practices were investigated through non-participant observation, using structured observation sheets. The analysis of the data revealed that HSC teachers as a group held various beliefs about the aforementioned issues: some of these beliefs can ‘empower’ teachers to realize constructivist approaches while others can ‘constrain’ them to the well-known traditional behaviorist practices. The majority of HSC teachers expressed mixed beliefs (‘empowering’ and ‘constraining’) and reported feeling overwhelmed, with little control over their teaching, due to contextual barriers, the rapid evolution of Computing and, subsequently, their lack of knowledge about current trends and didactics in this discipline, as well as the perceived students' culture about Computing as playing games and surfing the Internet. Data analysis also shows that there are synergies between HSC teachers' beliefs and practices. In the case of mixed beliefs, at least one ‘constraining’ belief is reflected in teachers' real practices.

In addition to traditional supercomputing clusters, parallel computing with multiple cores can be found in desktops, laptops, and even mobile smartphones. This ubiquitous parallelism in hardware presents a major challenge: the difficulty in easily extracting parallel performance via current software abstractions. Consequently, this paper presents an approach that reduces the learning curve to parallel programming by introducing such concepts into a visual (but currently sequential) programming language called Snap!, which was inspired by MIT’s Scratch project. Furthermore, our proposed visual abstractions can automatically generate parallel code for the end user to run in parallel on a variety of platforms from personal computing devices to supercomputers.

According to researchers, officers should be able to catalogue and prioritize threats and vulnerabilities, but is this only the case? Discrete studies detail and analyze in-depth risks related to smart cities, however, how these risks are addressed by workforce and how these are related to their competencies have not been thoroughly understood to date. If vulnerabilities are not understood and analyzed appropriately by the city workforce and stakeholders, unanticipated consequences and cascading failures may potential occur, even when crises are expected. The objective of this article is to inquire into responsibilities regarding crisis issues concerning the necessary competencies for resilience officers, by exploring current perceptions, expectations and recommendations as these are acknowledged in experts’ opinions and experiences. To do so, a questionnaire was developed and distributed to experts in the field, across various cities in Greece, to indicate responsibilities, and prioritize competencies that resilient officers in smart cities should possess. The findings highlighted significant responsibilities related to managing smart city risks and identified a distinct set of competencies unique to officers in this area, emphasizing the need for targeted efforts to enhance urban resilience through the initiatives led by city officers.

To help teachers in the latter aspect, a solution can be studying the entire process as a cyber-physical human system (CPHS). The paper consists of a brief report about the work carried out by authors to represent the entire classroom as a CPHS where the physical robots designed by students, humans (teachers and learners), and cybertechnologies are interconnected to accomplish a goal which is learning. The entire infrastructure could be seamlessly deployed into the classroom, supporting learning assessment and the feedback process starting from the deployment of a (quasi) real-time intelligent collection system.",,L.

article,UNTERNAHRER20241115,"In the realm of knowledge transmission, organizations face the challenge of finding effective strategies to engage individuals and facilitate knowledge transfer. Traditional methods often fall short, failing to capture individuals’ attention and ignite their motivation to actively participate in the knowledge transmission process. This article introduces Colearnis, a novel knowledge transmission platform, which allows peers to transfer knowledge in a gamified manner by using videos and quizzes which are directly created by the employees. This article also presents a long-term field study investigating the use of Colearnis with 130 employees in a worldwide metallurgy and tooling company. A multi-dimensional evaluation approach makes use of user surveys and behavior-tracking data to explore prospective avenues which might benefit knowledge transmission. Users have been profiled under demographical and managerial aspects, however also under their gamification user types according to the Hexad framework for gamification design. This study explores the connections between user profiles and engagement behaviors within Colearnis. The findings suggest that factors such as; age influence the achiever and philanthropist user types, however also that individuals with greater managerial duties are more likely to be classified as socializer, free-spirit, or philanthropist user types. Additionally, this study suggests that socializer or disruptor user types are more likely to consume or react to peers’ self-created knowledge. On the other hand, achiever user profiles are less likely to react or start quizzes. These findings equip organizations with valuable insights to further design and implement engaging ad-hoc knowledge transmission systems. These systems could be further tailored to align with individuals’ managerial profiles and gamification user types, optimizing engagement and increasing the likelihood of successful knowledge transmission.",,Charline Unternährer and Francesco Termine and Alessio {De Santo},,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2024.06.277,,,,1877-0509,Procedia Computer Science,"knowledge transmission, gamification, hexad framework, field study",,1115-1123,,Enhancing Knowledge Transmission: The Perspective of Gamification User Profiles,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050924015205,239.0,2024,CENTERIS – International Conference on ENTERprise Information Systems / ProjMAN - International Conference on Project MANagement / HCist - International Conference on Health and Social Care Information Systems and Technologies 2023,

In order to use IVR applications as an effective teaching and learning medium, it is important to understand the potential advantages and disadvantages of this technology compared to other media. This raises the question of what type of learning environment is most effective in promoting specific knowledge and skills. To answer these questions, a systematic review of research on learning with IVR in an educational context was conducted using the PRISMA method (Liberati et al., 2009; Page et al., 2021). The study analyzed 30 relevant research articles to compare the relative effectiveness of IVR-based learning and its impact on learner engagement, as outlined in the ICAP framework (Chi & Wylie, 2014). The results indicate that IVR has a positive impact on learning compared to other types of media. The study suggests that IVR technology is suitable for learning environments that prioritize active learner engagement and practical application, such as active manipulation and constructive creation.

This case study included 130 students with different programing preparation (authentic or traditional), who were exposed to computational learning modules. Control-Value Theory of Achievement Emotions is the conceptual framework that guided the evaluation of this investigation. Measures included student self-beliefs such as control and value appraisals, and their relationship with academic performance. Results suggest that programming preparation presented in an authentic engineering context provides an important foundation that goes beyond increasing students' control self-beliefs. This preparation seems to effectively enable students to leverage computational practices for the purpose of acquiring disciplinary concepts.

article,SERBAN20202812,"The new theory of education suggests that learner should be in the center of the learning process and the instructor playing an advising and facilitating role. Building smart learning environments supported by e-learning platforms is an important area of research. The rapid and continuous development of technology that has brought new learning skills for students forces the educational system to enter into a new era. This change is further justified by some unprecedented events that force students to learn remotely. QLearn is an e-learning platform developed as a web based application which provides quizzes for students enrolled at Advanced Programming Methods course from Babeş Bolyai University (Romania) as part of their formative and summative assessment. The existing set of quizzes has been proposed by students throughout the last three iterations of the course in a collaborative manner with course instructor, and this data set is expanding continuously with every new generation of students. QLearn is a smart learning environment offering the students valuable feedback and a good preparation for the exam. Some metrics that quantify the coverage rate of the course syllabus attained by students or their understanding level of knowledge are provided by QLearn. The Artificial Intelligent component of QLearn application uses these measures to make predictions for students’ outcomes at the exam, to find out which topics need to be practised more and to recommend learning plans according to students’ individual needs. The contribution of the paper is therefore twofold. Firstly, we propose a new learning design, based on students’ involvement in a collaborative manner. The second contribution of the paper is QLearn, a software application that provides support (implementation) for the proposed learning process design.

article,KWAK2022105541,"Background
Marked advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies throughout industries, including healthcare, necessitate a broader understanding their use. Particularly, intent to use AI-based healthcare technologies and its predictors among nursing students, who are prospective healthcare professionals, is required to promote the utilization of AI.
Objective
This study conducted a path analysis to predict nursing students' intent to use AI-based healthcare technologies based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology.
Design
A cross-sectional survey was performed.
Participants
The participants were 210 nursing students from two nursing schools in Korea.
Methods
This study established hypothetical paths for the influence of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, self-efficacy, and anxiety on intent to use AI-based technologies. Mediation of positive and negative attitudes and facilitating conditions' direct effects on intent to use were examined.
Results
Positive attitude toward AI (β = 0.485, p = .009) and facilitating conditions (β = 0.117, p = .045) predicted intent to use, whereas the path from negative attitude to intent to use was not significant. Performance expectancy, self-efficacy, and effort expectancy predicted positive attitude. Performance expectancy and self-efficacy had a negative effect on the path to negative attitude, whereas anxiety had a positive effect. Facilitating conditions did not significantly predict positive or negative attitude and only directly predicted intent to use. Social influence did not have a significant effect on intent to use.
Conclusions

Although this development is timely and important, it is also concerning because the elaboration of the AI field for K-12 is still ongoing. Current efforts may significantly underestimate the role of data, the fundamental component of an AI system. If the goal is to enable students to understand how AI systems work, knowledge of key concepts related to data processing is a prerequisite, as data collection, preparation, and engineering are closely linked to the functionality of AI systems. To advance the field, the following research provides a comprehensive collection of key data-related concepts relevant to K-12 computer science education. These concepts were identified through a theoretical review of the AI field, aligned through a review of AI curricula for school education, evaluated through interviews with domain experts and teachers, and structured hierarchically according to the data lifecycle.

Our study therefore looks to portray teachers' understanding, strategies and obstacles in teaching these skills across Latin American classrooms. To do so, we analyzed the responses to an online survey from 1391 active teachers across 20 countries in the region. This revealed varying understandings of 21st century skills, with little common understanding. Most teachers failed to mention the skills included in the most popular framework (the 4 Cs); those who did reported using the same strategies, regardless of the skill being taught. These strategies included project-based learning, oracy activities, literacy strategies, and teamwork.

article,LEHANE201652,"Since its introduction, pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) has been widely written about in the science education research literature. It has served as an alluring concept amongst many of the discussions on the teaching and learning of science. This paper reviews and draws together empirical research on a specific PCK lens, consisting of two tools: a Content Representation (CoRe) and Pedagogical and Professional Experiences Repertoires (PaP-eRs). Both tools were originally developed by Loughran et al. (2006) and have since been used by a variety of educational researchers and practitioners within their own contexts. This paper seeks to present how CoRes and PaP-eRs have helped conceptualise and advance PCK research, including the impact this has had on the professional practice of teachers. This paper, in so doing, also demonstrates how this PCK lens can facilitate effective teaching and learning in science education.

Moreover, this loss of competencies can reduce their employment opportunities while society itself is deprived of that human capital. Remote laboratories have emerged as a way of countering the effects of insufficient investment in equipment or the inability to acquire the latter. By way of example, the goal of Project R3, which is presented in this article, is to reduce the absence or shortage of laboratories in the rural world via the use of remote experimentation. Specifically, this article presents the experience, the results, and the main conclusions of Project R3 during its first year of life. It is worth noting that Project R3 has been deployed not only in rural but also in urban environments, making it possible to compare learning results and satisfaction levels for students in both spheres and identify those experiments that provide the best learning experience and are most popular among pupils and teachers. The main objective is that from the local analysis (the Project has only been conducted in Spain) it might be possible to draw conclusions of a global nature that might be extrapolated to other countries in the European Union with similar socio-demographics.

article,KOSIKOV2021492,"The paper considers the possibility of constructing a specialized computing system oriented at the transmission of data through information channels, that are determined taking into account the semantics of the selected data. In the process of computations the data is connected with semantic characteristics that describe the channel of computations, which can be considered as a method of semantic data enrichment. The system of information channels as a whole can be considered as an information graph describing the structuring of the processed data. The information graph supports the data model in the form of a network, the framework of which are objects and the relationships between them. The paper proposes language tools for determining the information graph and interpretation tools that provide practical computations. The set of information channels that make up the information graph can be considered as a low-level tool for data enrichment. The paper studies the possibility of determining tools of higher level. An applicative type language is proposed for defining information graphs, the syntax and semantics of the language are specified. The proposed language can be considered as an intermediate level tool for defining semantics. A procedure is proposed for compiling the language into a low-level construct, preserving the semantics of the language. The supporting system for the proposed computing system includes a low-level language interpreter, as well as an intermediate-level language compiler into a low-level language.

article,ELLERTON2022100975,"How critical thinking is understood has a logical impact on pedagogy and curriculum design in a critical thinking education. If critical thinking is seen as a complex mix of knowledge, skills and dispositions that can be articulated and made an object of study in themselves, then there is scope for intentional and explicit targeting of such things. If, however, critical thinking is seen as a general skill more or less impermeable to pedagogical influence and best realised through the development of content knowledge, then an explicit focus on developing thinking skills is misplaced and potentially distracting. The latter view is that of cognitive load theory (CLT), a theoretical framing of thinking and learning that has gained traction in education including with practitioners. This paper will explore some of the assumptions of CLT and show that they are either (1) in error, (2) vaguely or confusingly expressed and/or (3) the conclusions drawn within the theory are often errors of inference.

article,MAHAJAN2023100801,"The disruption in management education caused by COVID-19 was significant, creating a noteworthy impetus for new research. Given that COVID-19 has transitioned from pandemic to endemic, it is an opportune time to retrospect the contributions of related research to shape the future of management education. Using the SPAR-4-SLR protocol, a systematic literature review was conducted on management education research relating to COVID-19 published between 2020 and 2022. A total of 56 relevant articles were found in and retrieved from the Web of Science database and subsequently analyzed using descriptive and content analyses. The descriptive analysis revealed a steep increase in research on the impact of COVID-19 on management education over time, with most research appearing in The International Journal of Management Education. The contributions came from various countries, with the top five being the USA, the UK, Australia, India, and China. The content analysis showed that most research adopted empirical methodologies while self-determination theory emerged as the most popular theoretical lens for study. The related research revolved around five major themes—i.e., digital teaching and learning, collaboration and partnership, embracing uncertainty and building resilience, transformation and innovation, and developing an entrepreneurial mindset—and provided implications for management education in the new normal, wherein the priority is focused on enhancing education quality and preparing future business leaders for profound challenges in the new normal, thereby necessitating the development of innovative pedagogies and leadership competencies.",,Ritika Mahajan and Weng Marc Lim and Satish Kumar and Monica Sareen,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijme.2023.100801,,,,1472-8117,The International Journal of Management Education,"Coronavirus, COVID-19, Pandemic, Endemic, New normal, Business education, Management education, Impact, Lesson, Systematic literature review",2,100801,,COVID-19 and management education: From pandemic to endemic,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472811723000393,21.0,2023,,
article,KURENT2023e13738,"The significance of adapting to a rapidly changing world is quite evident in the current day; thus, the awareness of how to teach students so that they can be ready to face challenges in the future is very important. Early education has a huge impact on the further development of children, so preschool teachers must be competent and use appropriate teaching and educational methods. In this study, the development of self-directed learning (SDL) of future preschool teachers is investigated by considering two variables, namely the type of study (full-time and part-time students) and the learning modalities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (pre-, during and post-COVID-19 confinement). We collected data from 418 participants and analysed them using descriptive statistics, 2 × 3 factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a two-step cluster analysis. The results show the status of pre-service preschool teachers' perceptions of their SDL development and how the variables influenced it. There were significant differences in the students' self-reported SDL skills, depending on the learning environment and the type of study. The status indicator helps educators identify and change the curriculum and how they work with students. It allows the faculty to highlight the positive aspects of the different educational modalities encountered, as well as the characteristics of the study types and their impact on the learning process to improve students’ SDL skills. The results of the study may help in the design of tailored metacognitive scaffolds that take into account different modalities.

article,SUYANTO2022116857,"Diabetes is one of the deadliest and costliest diseases. Today, automatic diabetes detection systems are primarily developed using deep learning (DL) approaches, which give high accuracy in classifying patients into two classes: have diabetes or not. Unfortunately, DL is a high-complexity and unexplainable black-box model. This paper proposes a new nearest neighbor-based framework to tackle those issues in classifying two diabetes datasets: binary-class Pima India Diabetes Dataset (PIDD) and multiclass Diabetes Type. A k-means clustering (KMC) is first carried out to remove the noises or outliers and keep the competent data in the training set. The dimension of the competent data is then reduced using an autoencoder (AE) to minimize the distances of the intra-class data but maximize that of the inter-class. A k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier and two variants: pseudo nearest neighbor rule (PNNR) and local mean-based pseudo nearest neighbor (LMPNN), are used to detect diabetes. In addition, a new variant named multi-voter multi-commission nearest neighbor (MVMCNN) is introduced. An investigation based on 5-fold cross-validation (FCV) informs that, for binary-class PIDD, the proposed combination of KMC, AE, and MVMCNN achieves the highest accuracy of 99.13%, which is slightly higher than the state-of-the-art DL-based detection model that produces 98.07%. An evaluation based on 10-FCV also indicates that, for the multiclass Diabetes Type, it obtains a higher accuracy of 95.24% than the DL-based model for predicting diabetes that gives 94.02%.",,Suyanto Suyanto and Selly Meliana and Tenia Wahyuningrum and Siti Khomsah,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.116857,,,,0957-4174,Expert Systems with Applications,"Diabetes detection, -nearest neighbor, -means clustering, Dimensional reduction, Multi-voter multi-commission",,116857,,A new nearest neighbor-based framework for diabetes detection,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422003074,199.0,2022,,

It reflects on the value that is promised for tertiary education, teaching, and learning. Separating hype from the realistic possibilities, the connections between advances in technology, policy, and development challenges are critically examined to consider how the 4IR could impact on tertiary education, and teaching and learning, in the future. It then proceeds to examine the enabling conditions which need to be cultivated at national, institutional, and individual levels, and the challenges and obstacles to be overcome at these levels, for enduring benefits to be realized. The paper explores what the phenomenon of the 4IR is, drawing on the arguments of key proponents, including skeptics. It explores what kinds of changes are envisaged as the phenomenon progresses. It then proceeds to examine how institutions may be positioned to harness the 4IR for the benefit of human wellbeing, and in support of national and international social and economic benefits. The promise of the 4IR to resolve our developmental challenges has been sharply questioned—perhaps being overhyped, given existing and enduring disadvantage and marginalization that was not ameliorated in previous industrial revolutions.

It is found that the participating students were able to propose an authentic scenario, apply their new knowledge of AI and think up meaningful AI-driven solutions in their digital stories. Furthermore, we examined students' DSW process in terms of inquiry-based pedagogical cycle (orientation, conceptualization, investigation, conclusion, discussion) to demonstrate how they learn AI. Overall, DSW as an inquiry could effectively foster students' AI literacy in using and applying AI knowledge to solve real-life problems, far beyond merely knowing and understanding related concepts.

article,MIRANDA2024100312,"Background
COVID-19 prompted a global shift to online learning, including video conference-assisted online learning (VCAOL), which necessitated educators understanding students' perspectives.
Objective
This study aims to develop machine learning (ML) model-agnostic interpretability that could predict students' academic performance in VCAOL.
Material and methods
Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and data augmentation were used to handle imbalanced data from small-scale datasets. The prediction model was developed using Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB). SHAP model-agnostic interpretability was used to interpret and comprehend prediction findings. The data was gathered from September 2022 to January 2023, resulting in 361 records. The research variables included students' academic performance as the dependent variable, and the video conference application (VC), learning material (LM), internet connection (IC), students' ability to learn (SL), and student knowledge (SK) as independent variables, which were mapped into 28 attributes.
Result
The SMOTE improved the performance of three algorithms, with RF outperforming SVM and GNB in almost all tests, achieving an accuracy of 79.45%, precision of 75.71%, and recall of 79.45%. SHAP bar plots ranked attributes by importance demonstrated that “Performance,” “Frequency Constraint,” and “Increase Value” had a significant impact on prediction results. When we mapped the three attributes to our study perspective, we determined that SK and SL were the most important views for students to perform well in VCAOL. SHAP's beeswarm revealed students' performance in VCAOL was positively correlated with “Performance”, “Increase Value”, “Completing Project”, “Adequate Method”, “User Interface”, and “Feature”. As we mapped the three attributes to our study perspective, we found that SK, LM, SL, and VC were positively related to students' performance in VCAOL.
Conclusion

article,CATALA20131930,"A considerable part of the behavior in smart environments relies on event-driven and rule specification. Rules are the mechanism most often used to enable user customization of the environment. However, the expressiveness of the rules available to users in editing and other tools is usually either limited or the available rule editing interfaces are not designed for end-users with low skills in programming. This means we have to look for interaction techniques and new ways to define user customization rules. This paper describes a generic and flexible meta-model to support expressive rules enhanced with data flow expressions that will graphically support the definition of rules without writing code. An empirical study was conducted on the ease of understanding of the visual data flow expressions, which are the key elements in our rule proposal. The visual dataflow language was compared to its corresponding textual version in terms of comprehension and ease of learning by teenagers in exercises involving calculations, modifications, writing and detecting equivalences in expressions in both languages. Although the subjects had some previous experience in editing mathematical expressions on spreadsheets, the study found their performance with visual dataflows to be significantly better in calculation and modification exercises. This makes our dataflow approach a promising mechanism for expressing user-customized reactive behavior in Ambient Intelligence (AmI) environments. The performance of the rule matching processor was validated by means of two stress tests to ensure that the meta-model approach adopted would be able to scale up with the number of types and instances in the space.",,Alejandro Catala and Patricia Pons and Javier Jaen and Jose A.

Numerous studies have shown that AI robots may provide new opportunities for learning designs in school settings or professional training. However, there is no review examining the role and research foci of AI-Robots in Education (AIRE) research. This study therefore explored the research trends of AIRE by conducting a systematic review of SSCI (Social Sciences Citation Index) journal articles published in the Web of Science (WoS). The study analyzed the participants, duration of the studies, learning environments, application domains, data analysis, evaluations of learners' performance, learning strategies, roles of AI-robots, and research issues. The research findings are concluded as follows: (1) The countries of Canada, Chile, and South Korea invested in AIRE research early, and focused on students' learning performance and learning behavior. (2) Most AIRE research focuses on research targets under the age of 13 and completed experiments within 4 weeks in a physical environment. Most AIRE research has been applied in the disciplines of Language and Science, and problem-solving related strategies and mixed strategies are the most commonly used strategies. (3) AI-robots are often applied and regarded as tutees or tutors. Regardless of what the AI-robot's role is, learning performance is the most widely focused variable in AIRE research. Furthermore, attitudes, opinions of learners or learning perceptions and learning behavior are other frequently discussed themes.

article,ROBINSON2024100087,"In recent years, we have seen many examples of software products unintentionally causing demonstrable harm. Many guidelines for ethical and responsible computing have been developed in response. Dominant approaches typically attribute liability and blame to individual companies or actors, rather than understanding how the working practices, norms, and cultural understandings in the software industry contribute to such outcomes. In this paper, we propose an understanding of responsibility that is infrastructural, relational, and cultural; thus, providing a foundation to better enable responsible software engineering into the future. Our approach draws on Young's (2006) social connection model of responsibility and Star and Ruhleder's (1994) concept of infrastructure. By bringing these theories together we introduce a concept called infrastructural injustice, which offers a new way for software engineers to consider their opportunities for responsible action with respect to society and the planet.

article,CAMARGO2024326,"Amidst the ongoing technological expansion, IoT-based applications have established their presence in various scenarios, including smart homes, healthcare, wearable devices, and more. However, fostering robust social relationships among objects within intelligent environments requires considering a multitude of parameters, from historical transactions data to peer opinions on interaction experiences. Our primary objective is to introduce the VISO concept, a finely tuned approach for community formation and facilitating autonomous interactions among Social IoT objects. Key contributions of VISO include: (i) a recommendation mechanism for cultivating friendships; (ii) the virtualization of devices, known as Virtual Objects, based on the Digital Twin concept; (iii) object ranking, determined by peer evaluations at the edge; and (iv) profiling the identity of each object within the environment. The VISO approach is rooted in the link analysis model, which seeks to uncover connections between individuals and qualify interactions. Additionally, the construction of social circles is guided by the Organizational Network Analysis model, a concept grounded in social networks designed to simplify the initiation of new friendships. The VISO approach stands out through its amalgamation of dynamic trust mechanisms, object virtualization, real-time interaction monitoring, and the highlighting of the most active objects. These characteristics collectively contribute to its effectiveness in managing relationships within the social IoT, while simultaneously addressing challenges posed by alternative models. Preliminary results in a testing environment substantiate the model’s capability to categorize interactions and identify the most beneficial object roles for establishing new relationships. In particular, by selecting the most active objects 30%, they account for a staggering 90% of local actions. These validation outcomes lay the foundation for planned future work and enhancements to the VISO approach. Encouraged by the promising results, the inception of a significant project is on the horizon. The application of the VISO approach to relationship management within a smart campus for ubiquitous education underscores the remarkable versatility and potential of Social IoT.

article,CETIN2021652,"Background
In the etiology of functional chest pain (FCP), parental personality traits are worth considering in the context of the biopsychosocial model. The αlpha factor sub-dimension of the five-factor personality model (5FPM) includes agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism. There is increasing evidence that this dimension may be related to psychosomatic diseases. It was aimed to investigate how maternal personality traits affect adolescents with FCP. The hypothesis was determined that adolescents diagnosed with FCP can have lower quality of life and be more depressive/anxious and their mothers can have factor-α personality traits and be more depressive/anxious.
Methods
The sample of this single-center, cross-sectional, case-control study consisted of 25 adolescents with FCP and their parents. The control group consisted of 35 age and sex matched healthy adolescents and their parents. Psychopathology was screened using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) and psychiatric comorbidities were excluded. The Child Depression Inventory (CDI), the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and KINDL forms were completed by the adolescents. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Five-Factor Personality Inventory short form (FFPI) were completed by the parents.
Results
Mothers of adolescents with FCP scored significantly higher compared with mothers of healthy controls in agreeableness and conscientiousness and scored significantly lower in neuroticism. Higher levels of mothers’ neuroticism scores were associated with higher CDI and STAI-1 scores in FCP group. Agreeableness (Exp (B) = 10.097; p = .004; confidence interval [CI] = 2.049-49.745) and conscientiousness (Exp (B) = 16.414; p = .011; CI = 1.902-141.682) were statiscally significant in regression model.
Conclusions

The findings reveal that DC is often used as an umbrella term for technology-related learning tasks that nevertheless fail to actively engage students in practicing DC in a critical manner. In addition, older students are often asked to develop DC in project-based learning outside the school setting. While interdisciplinary approaches to DC have been proposed, disciplines such as philosophy or ecology—apparently necessary to work on citizenship—are not considered.

article,CHENG2024104948,"Previous studies have reported mixed results regarding the relationship between students’ use of self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies and their performance in introductory programming courses. These studies were constrained by their reliance on self-report questionnaires as a means of collecting and analysing data. To address this limitation, this study aimed to employ eye-tracking and retrospective think-aloud techniques to identify differences in SRL strategy use for program comprehension tasks between high-performing students (N = 31) and low-performing students (N = 31) in an undergraduate programming course. All participants attended individual eye-tracking sessions to comprehend two Python program codes with different constructs. Their eye-tracking data and video-recalled retrospective think-aloud data were captured and recorded for analysis. The findings reveal that higher-order cognitive skills, such as elaboration and critical thinking, were mostly adopted by high-performing students, while basic cognitive and resource management strategy, such as rehearsal and help-seeking, were mostly employed by low-performing students when comprehending the program codes. This study not only demonstrates the design of combining eye-tracking and retrospective think-aloud data to explore students’ use of SRL strategies but also provides evidence to support the notion that program comprehension is a complex process that cannot be effectively addressed by employing merely rudimentary strategies, such as repetitively reading the same code segment.

In this study, researchers used learning with augmented reality to find its effect on student learning outcomes in grade 8 junior high school, which has an average age of 13 years. The research design used in this study was a quasi-experimental nonequivalent control group design. This study, 2 sample classes were taken: an experimental class (learning with augmented reality) and a control class (learning without augmented reality). The experimental and control classes have the same characteristics; each has 20 male and 20 female students. The instrument used in this research is a geometric thinking ability test. This study uses a test instrument in the form of essay questions. The instrument was given twice, namely during the pretest and post-test. There are ten essay questions made. After obtaining the data from the pretest and post-test results, the normalized gain score formula (N-Gain) was used to know the increase in geometric thinking skills. The N-Gain result of the experimental class is 78% or 0.78, which is in the high category. Whereas in the control class, it was 50% or 0.58, this result is in the moderate category. The N-gain results show that there is a difference between the experimental class and the control class. In this case, the effectiveness of using augmented reality for learning geometry in junior high school students is higher than those who did not receive augmented reality treatment. From the N-gain value, it proves that learning using augmented reality learning media is effective in increasing the ability to think Geometry. Then the results of observations made during learning activities using augmented reality show that students look active and make students more enthusiastic when learning Geometry. The results of the responses showed that 39 students had become more proactive in learning Geometry by using augmented reality applications.",,Heni Pujiastuti and Rudi Haryadi,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2024.03.180,,,,1877-0509,Procedia Computer Science,"augmented reality, thinking ability, geometry",,1738-1745,,The Effectiveness of Using Augmented Reality on the Geometry Thinking Ability of Junior High School Students,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050924005398,234.0,2024,Seventh Information Systems International Conference (ISICO 2023),

We present the train the teacher method (TTM) which formalizes a method for IDC researchers to use when deploying and validating an educational system. Our key findings indicate the need to work in partnership with classroom teachers, providing both initial training and continued support. This will both result in more valuable research data, and address a gap in teachers’ continued professional development. The TTM aims to ensure that teachers, students, and researchers can benefit from innovative educational systems deployed in real classroom contexts. We believe that the TTM could be adapted to other domains of study within interaction design community. The paper goes on to argue the more general point that the interaction design and children community should shift emphasis away from technology innovation and towards reporting replicable longitudinal research findings from real-world settings.

article,ROMEROORGANVIDEZ2024112150,"Feature models are the de facto standard for modelling variabilities and commonalities in features and relationships in software product lines. They are the base artefacts in many engineering activities, such as product configuration, derivation, or testing. Concrete models in different domains exist; however, many are in private or sparse repositories or belong to discontinued projects. The dispersion of knowledge of feature models hinders the study and reuse of these artefacts in different studies. The Universal Variability Language (UVL) is a community effort textual feature model language that promotes a common way of serializing feature models independently of concrete tools. Open science principles promote transparency, accessibility, and collaboration in scientific research. Although some attempts exist to promote feature model sharing, the existing solutions lack open science principles by design. In addition, existing and public feature models are described using formats not always supported by current tools. This paper presents , a repository of feature models in UVL format. provides a front end that facilitates the search, upload, storage, and management of feature model datasets, improving the capabilities of discontinued proposals.

article,FOUOTSAMANFOUO2022e11637,"Not many efforts have been made so far to understand the effects of both the 2015–2016 drought and the 2020 lockdown measures on the agricultural production of smallholder vis-a-vis commercial farmers in Kwazulu-Natal. Google Earth Engine, and random forest algorithm, are used to generate a dataset that help to investigate this question. A regression is performed on double differenced data to investigate the effects of interest. A k-mean cluster analysis, is also used to determine whether the distribution patterns of crop production changed with drought and disruption of agricultural production input. Results show that: (1) droughts affected the agricultural production of both areas similarly. Crop cover declined in both areas for one season after droughts were broken. Then recovery was driven by greener, more productive crops rather than the expansion of crop area. (2) The response of both areas to the COVID-19 lockdown was also similar. Both smallholder and commercial areas' Normalised Difference Vegetation Index – a proxy for crop vitality – improved in response to regulations favourable to the sector and improved rainfall. No significant adjustments in crop cover were observed. Production therefore changed primarily at the intensive margin (improved productivity of existing croplands) rather than the extensive (changing the extent of land under cultivation). (3) Cluster analysis allows for a more granular view, showing that the positive impact of lockdowns on agriculture were concentrated in areas with high rainfall and close proximity to metropolitan markets.

article,DEJONG2023100536,"Many studies investigating inquiry learning in science domains have appeared over the years. Throughout this period, inquiry learning has been regularly criticized by scholars who favor direct instruction over inquiry learning. In this vein, Zhang, Kirschner, Cobern, and Sweller (2022) recently asserted that direct instruction is overall superior to inquiry-based instruction and reproached policy makers for ignoring this fact. In the current article we reply to this assertion and the premises on which it is based. We review the evidence and argue that a more complete and correct interpretation of the literature demonstrates that inquiry-based instruction produces better overall results for acquiring conceptual knowledge than does direct instruction. We show that this conclusion holds for controlled, correlational, and program-based studies. We subsequently argue that inquiry-based and direct instruction each have their specific virtues and disadvantages and that the effectiveness of each approach depends on moderating factors such as the learning goal, the domain involved, and students' prior knowledge and other student characteristics. Furthermore, inquiry-based instruction is most effective when supplemented with guidance that can be personalized based on these moderating factors and can even involve providing direct instruction. Therefore, we posit that a combination of inquiry and direct instruction may often be the best approach to support student learning. We conclude that policy makers rightfully advocate inquiry-based instruction, particularly when students’ investigations are supplemented with direct instruction at appropriate junctures.",,Ton {de Jong} and Ard W.

This paper presents an investigation of fourth- and fifth-grade students engaging in Making activities to create simulation, concept-process, and illustrative models in the science classroom. Based on video analyses of the Making-based class sessions, a generalized process model was developed for each type of science model. In addition, cross-cutting themes were found in Making-based science modeling: first, there are two loops that intersect and interact with each other (modeling for Making and modeling for Science content), and they interrelate in various ways depending on science model type; and second, showcasing Making products (sharing with peers, teachers, or helpers) is a primary factor that determines students’ overall engagement with science in the activity. We suggest that Making-based science kit and lesson design needs to support students to showcase their Making output, on top of science-related reflections, and to consider the balance between Making and science activity.

article,MAHOWALD2024517,"Large language models (LLMs) have come closest among all models to date to mastering human language, yet opinions about their linguistic and cognitive capabilities remain split. Here, we evaluate LLMs using a distinction between formal linguistic competence (knowledge of linguistic rules and patterns) and functional linguistic competence (understanding and using language in the world). We ground this distinction in human neuroscience, which has shown that formal and functional competence rely on different neural mechanisms. Although LLMs are surprisingly good at formal competence, their performance on functional competence tasks remains spotty and often requires specialized fine-tuning and/or coupling with external modules. We posit that models that use language in human-like ways would need to master both of these competence types, which, in turn, could require the emergence of separate mechanisms specialized for formal versus functional linguistic competence.",,Kyle Mahowald and Anna A.

The existing literature on game jam learning consists mostly of descriptive individual case studies, with very incohesive and varied research aims, methods, and settings. Thus far, there have been no attempts to further analyze and classify the reported results of the previous studies. This article looks at existing research on game jams and learning, comparing the reported learning results to the future-oriented skills and knowledge. The data set, created utilizing the PRISMA checklist, consists of 25 original articles published between 2010 and 2022. The results show that participation in a game jam event will likely increase interdisciplinary, epistemic, and procedural knowledge. Furthermore, it can increase disciplinary knowledge depending on the theme and other framings of the event. Participation in a game jam event will likely further cognitive and metacognitive skills as well as social and emotional skills, provided the jam event is organized to create a safe and inclusive space for learning. Participation in a game jam will also likely further diverse practical and physical skills, but the adoption of these skills varies depending on individuals’ tasks inside their team.

article,PRINSLOO2018263,"Humanitarian and other development organisations are calling for replicable self-sustaining solutions to shared micro-utilities to ensure equitable modern energy delivery to energy-deprived village communities. Distributed smart microgrid technology allows for the efficient integration of sustainable resources to provide localised energy delivery at improved levels of reliability and resilience. Smart energy management in decentralised renewable systems requires computational intelligence to implement pivotal energy-aware/cost-aware procedures in decision-making for a conceptualised next generation Smart Village microgrid platform. Smart Village microgrid control automation aims at offering pragmatic and, intelligent control capabilities to perform price-based demand response energy management. This paper proposes the use of cascaded control abstraction in the implementation of a price-sensitive cyber-physical Smart Grid approach in a rural off-grid microgrid environment. The modular microgrid design integrates renewable energy resources through an adaptive control algorithm developed in a model-based design approach. The solution is based on distributed market-based control, using multi-agent transactive principles to navigate automated demand response. Multi-priority load clusters with the selective parallel control of non-intelligent device groups allow for prioritised supply/demand resource coordination. The proposed Smart Village solution operates as a self-regulating smart microgrid energy management system and by virtue of its market-based transactive reasoning approach is able to meet multiple operating requirements of rural village energy systems.

The account gives an extended description of one PAD approach and summarizes four others, noting common characteristics among them. It concludes with a discussion of how PAD approaches can be extended into the domain of instruction, and a consideration of why PAD is not so commonly recognized by educational professionals.",Oxford,Mark Wilson and Sean Tan,International Encyclopedia of Education (Fourth Edition),https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-818630-5.10022-3,Fourth Edition,Robert J Tierney and Fazal Rizvi and Kadriye Ercikan,978-0-12-818629-9,,,"Assessment design, Cognition, Interpretation, Tests, Observation",,146-162,Elsevier,Principled assessment design,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128186305100223,,2023,,
article,TSAI2023104849,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced universities and schools around the world to adopt online learning. Teachers may wonder if their students can attain satisfactory learning performance in an online learning environment without teachers' on-the-spot attention. In order to develop students' skills in programming, promote their enjoyment of learning and intention to learn to program, the researchers integrated two innovative teaching approaches, using online peer-facilitated learning and distributed pair programming, and investigated the effects of these on students' online learning performance. This study conducted an experiment that included 128 undergraduates from four class sections of Department of Finance. Thus, the experimental design in this research was a 2 (Peer-facilitated learning vs. non-peer-facilitated learning) × 2 (Distributed pair programming vs. non-distributed pair programming) factorial pretest/post-test design. The participants in this research mainly consisted of four classes of students from a non-computer or information department who took a compulsory course on programming design.’ Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected in this study. According to the results, the peer-facilitated learning group exhibited significantly better development of programming skills, enjoyment of learning, and intention to learn, than the non-peer-facilitated learning group. However, expected effects of enhancing the learning of the students in this study who received the distributed pair programming were not found. The design of online pedagogy can be a reference for online educators.

article,TAN2020194429,"Prediction of gene function and gene regulatory networks is one of the most active topics in bioinformatics. The accumulation of publicly available gene expression data for hundreds of plant species, together with advances in bioinformatical methods and affordable computing, sets ingenuity as one of the major bottlenecks in understanding gene function and regulation. Here, we show how a credit card-sized computer retailing for <50 USD can be used to rapidly predict gene function and infer regulatory networks from RNA sequencing data. To achieve this, we constructed a bioinformatical pipeline that downloads and allows quality-control of RNA sequencing data; and generates a gene co-expression network that can reveal enzymes and transcription factors participating and controlling a given biosynthetic pathway. We exemplify this by first identifying genes and transcription factors involved in the biosynthesis of secondary cell wall in the plant Artemisia annua, the main natural source of the anti-malarial drug artemisinin. Networks were then used to dissect the artemisinin biosynthesis pathway, which suggest potential transcription factors regulating artemisinin biosynthesis. We provide the source code of our pipeline (https://github.com/mutwil/LSTrAP-Lite) and envision that the ubiquity of affordable computing, availability of biological data and increased bioinformatical training of biologists will transform the field of bioinformatics.

incollection,ROVENOLT2019143,"There is long-standing and widespread support for educational initiatives that introduce undergraduates to scientific research. Research experiences can lead to gains in students’ general skills, such as oral visual and written communication, as well as more specific research-associated skills. Traditionally, undergraduates have been introduced to research primarily through the apprentice model, in which undergraduates join a research group and receive one-on-one guidance from a mentor. This model, while effective, limits the number of students who can engage in research experiences and tends to be more accessible to students who are familiar with the research enterprise. There is therefore an increasing emphasis on developing opportunities for students to engage in research in credit-bearing courses, extending the benefits of research experiences to a larger and more diverse group. These course-based research experiences can provide many of the same benefits students derive from traditional undergraduate research experiences, such as increased content knowledge and analytical skills and persistence in science.

Playful Learning Landscapes increase the accessibility of early STEM learning in everyday public spaces (e.g., bus stops, grocery stores) by merging principles of guided play and STEM learning goals with local community's values. We used community-based design research to (1) identify Latine families’ funds of knowledge related to play, science, and math learning, and (2) create designs for playful environments merging families’ values and practices with guided play and STEM learning principles. Our design partners were 32 parents, primarily Spanish-speaking immigrant mothers from Mexico, and two directors of a local community organization. The design process consisted of co-design sessions, interviews, inductive thematic analysis, elaboration, playtest and feedback, and iteration. Our findings showed that familismo, heritage representation, and the meaning of community spaces influenced the ways families engaged in STEM learning and the learning environments they desired in their community. Moreover, families’ STEM practices were rooted in everyday experiences of playing cultural games, family food routines, and outdoor activities. Incorporating Latine parents in the design process and leveraging their funds of knowledge resulted in culturally situated designs aligned with playful and STEM learning principles.

article,RAMOSVEGA2021100405,"The motivation to stimulate children’s learning engagement could be found in the fact that learning is not always motivational in itself. This is particularly true when learning is obligatory and based upon material that has not been chosen by the children themselves. A Lean UX approach to the co-design of an educational serious videogame (MOBI) is proposed in this paper. The core idea is that children's natural interest in playing can be stimulated by engendering the feeling that they are participating in the creation of something. The hypothesis is that this approach can increase the children's level of engagement and can facilitate their awareness of their learning perception. With the aim of testing this hypothesis, this paper describes an experience with 50 children with ages between 10 and 12 years old. The results indicate that the children’s satisfaction grew significantly during the process, with an important reduction in the requests for changes and that 60% had the perception of having learned.

article,MORRISON2024100209,"This study took place at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic when most schools worldwide were making the transition to online teaching and learning. Through this single-case study design, the study examined the learning experiences of a group of teachers engaged in interactive, inquiry-based professional learning focused on math, making and coding during a shift to emergency remote teaching. The primary objective was to identify promising practices for online professional learning (PL) focused on math and coding using a maker-pedagogies approach to teaching and learning, based on the teachers’ learning experiences. Study participants included 20 teachers from a rural school board in Northern Ontario, Canada. Findings indicated that the following may be considered as promising practices when developing and implementing virtual math and coding PL from a maker perspective. It is important to: a) balance sessions focused on specific math and coding content with more general sessions focused on learning the various maker-technology tools; b) include both synchronous and asynchronous learning opportunities for the variety of teachers involved in the learning; c) include collaborative learning in the teacher PL and a virtual platform that can support this type of social learning; d) ensure the PL sessions are on-going as opposed to one-off or isolated sessions.

article,XU2022101985,"Recently, the term “fake news” has been broadly and extensively utilized for disinformation, misinformation, hoaxes, propaganda, satire, rumors, click-bait, and junk news. It has become a serious problem around the world. We present a new system, FaNDS, that detects fake news efficiently. The system is based on several concepts used in some previous works but in a different context. There are two main concepts: an Inconsistency Graph and Energy Flow. The Inconsistency Graph contains news items as nodes and inconsistent opinions between them for edges. Energy Flow assigns each node an initial energy and then some energy is propagated along the edges until the energy distribution on all nodes converges. To illustrate FaNDS we use the original data from the Fake News Challenge (FNC-1). First, the data has to be reconstructed in order to generate the Inconsistency Graph. The graph contains various subgraphs with well-defined shapes that represent different types of connections between the news items. Then the Energy Flow method is applied. The nodes with high energy are the candidates for being fake news. In our experiments, all these were indeed fake news as we checked each using several reliable web sites.

However, students already form conceptions about modern technologies (especially AI) from their interaction with their everyday environment. In this paper, we conduct a systematic scoping review on the emerging research field of secondary school students' mental models and attitudes regarding AI. Our goal is to identify research approaches and uncover research gaps. To achieve this, we reviewed literature published within the timeframe of 2012–2022 found in the ACM, IEEE, ERIC, and Science Direct databases. In total, we identified 18 relevant papers, for which we collected and evaluated research objectives, approaches, results, and areas requiring further investigation. Our findings reveal that most of the literature examined focuses with students' attitudes toward AI and moderating variables. Additionally, there is preliminary research on the types of mental models students possess about AI.

article,ETUKAKPAN2023100234,"Background
A needs-based approach is desirable for the transformation of pharmaceutical education, and to link pharmaceutical education with the health needs of populations and national priorities. There are varying levels of data in the literature on the status of pharmaceutical education in all six World Health Organization (WHO) regions, especially in the context of needs identification and evidence-based policy interventions. The framework for this study was the FIP Development Goals.
Objectives
The aim of the study was to develop evidence-based policies through a needs-based approach for pharmaceutical education transformation nationally, regionally and globally by addressing the following objectives: 1. Identify global and regional needs in pharmaceutical education, through a regional SWOT analysis and prioritization of FIP development goals; 2. Develop valid and credible regional roadmaps for pharmaceutical education advancement according to the identified prioritized goals and 3. Develop a global call to action as a policy intervention for advancing pharmaceutical education.
Methods
This study was conducted between 2020 and 2021 using a mixed methods approach. Surveys of higher education institutions and a series of qualitative interviews were conducted with national professional leadership organizations, with further regional workshops having 284 participants recruited from the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) membership base, spanning all six WHO regions.
Results
Eleven out of 21 FIP DGs were identified as priorities for regional roadmaps and FIP DG 1 (Academic capacity) was identified as a priority in four regions. All regions had distinctive results with an area of commonality between them. There were common weaknesses in the adoption of competency-based education and inter-professional education.
Conclusions
It is critical for every country and region to develop needs- and evidence-based policies for the transformation of pharmaceutical education, for which FIP DGs provide a systematic framework.",,Alison Etukakpan and Nilhan Uzman and Ozge Ozer and Toyin Tofade and Silvana Nair Leite and Arinola Joda and Yahya Choonara and Chiluba Mwila and Lilian M.

In K-12 education, much is left to be known about how to develop curricula to more effectively foster students’ design and creative thinking. This study introduced maker education to the information technology course to investigate the effects of design-oriented making on students’ learning of programming, creativity, and design thinking. Seventy-two fifth-grade students from two classes at a rural primary school in China participated in this eight-week study. Both classes learned about programming a digital greeting card with Mind+, when the experimental group was taught with a design-oriented making pedagogy, whereas the control group learned through a conventional teaching approach. Questionnaires were used to assess students’ knowledge learning, creativity and design thinking competence. Findings showed that when embedded in an open-ended problem-solving context, integrating design thinking into making as a pedagogy can be conducive to the development of design thinking and creativity.

article,CAMPBELL2022e09191,"An engaging first programming class (CS1) often inspires students’ passion for computer science (CS). However, the evidence in the literature suggests that the average CS1 classes are anything but engaging for many students. The performance of CS compared to other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses in international student engagement surveys seems to substantiate CS1 failure, attrition rates, and lack of diversity in most CS classes. Meanwhile, for its simplicity in introducing programming to beginners, primary and secondary schools use Scratch, an educational programming environment developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA. For the same reason, higher institutions now include some forms of Scratch instruction in CS1. The question remains, to what extent is Scratch engaging, especially for students in higher education? This study addressed this gap by observing college computer science students exposed to a constructionist Scratch programming pedagogy. We adopted a descriptive design based on quantitative observations. To observe the class during a weekly 2-hour session, we employed five CS educators, one observer per week. Each observer, employing a 20-item observation protocol, rated the extent of affective, behavioral, and cognitive engagement of first-year CS students in a polytechnic in North Central Nigeria. Most of the students were learning to program for the first time. Analysis of the data showed a significant agreement in the ratings of the five observers for overall student engagement, although the impact was moderate. However, while agreement in their ratings for affective engagement was significant, with a large effect, there was no significant concordance in their ratings for behavioral engagement. Observers also significantly agreed in their ratings for cognitive engagement; however, the impact was moderate.

Works of renowned authors, as well as some of their main commentators, were addressed to report the development of enactive approach. We indicate that the enactive approach transcends its original context within biology, and at a second moment within connectionism, changes the understanding of the relationships so far established between the body and the environment, and the ideas of conceptual relationships between the mind and the body. The influence on computational theories is of great importance, leading to new artificial intelligence systems as well as the proposition of complex, autopoietic and alive machines.

article,DING2024105075,"Game-based learning (GBL) has garnered significant attention as a means to enhance student science learning. However, researchers often broadly categorize GBL without specific attention to teachers' practices or the different game-based pedagogies (GBPs) such as serious game-based learning and learning by making games. Serious game-based learning involves the use of games designed primarily for purposes beyond entertainment, engaging students in learning activities. Learning by making games goes further by enabling students to construct and expand their knowledge through creative activities. Furthermore, the impact of students' weekly gaming hours on their academic performance under different GBPs has not been thoroughly explored. In this study, we analyzed pre- and post-science unit assessment data to investigate the effects of serious game-based learning and learning by making games, along with gaming hours, on the science learning outcomes of 129 sixth-grade students in a Midwestern urban school district in the United States. Employing Bayesian paired t-tests and ANOVA, we examined the effects of two GBPs (serious game learning and game-making) implemented by two science teachers and the interaction between each GBP and students' weekly gaming hours. Our findings indicate that both GBPs led to improvements in students’ learning, with those participating in making games showing an average increase of 3.5 points more on the posttests than those engaged in serious game-based learning. Additionally, data on student-reported weekly gaming hours showed that in both GBP conditions, students with medium gaming hours showed the most improvement compared to those with fewer or more gaming hours. There was also a potential interaction between types of GBP and the effect of gaming hours outcomes in that the learning gain difference between the two GBPs was more pronounced among students reporting fewer gaming hours, although this effect was not significant.

article,WANG2023458,"Hutong neighbourhoods, composed of Chinese courtyard dwellings (Siheyuan), are historically and socially significant urban spaces that embody the traditional Chinese way of life and philosophy. As part of the national heritage, there is an increasing research interest in Hutong neighbourhoods, many of which are facing oblivion. This study presents a formal grammar for Hutong neighbourhood generation. This research investigates traditional principles of urban planning of ancient Beijing, based on examples on the historical map Qianlong Jingcheng Quantu, to derive the lost design rules. These rules are used to build up a procedural modelling framework, which reveals the development of Beijing's urban structure from the Yuan (1271–1368) to the Qing (1644–1911) dynasty. Our findings present a grammar incorporated into the procedural modelling framework to parametrically generate Hutong neighbourhoods, which replicates the morphological characteristics of historic cases. It contributes to the understanding of the generation of Hutong neighbourhoods. In support of heritage sustainability, this grammar can be implemented in a computational environment by visual scripting that enables the generation of new instances of Hutong neighbourhoods, both real and virtual.",,Yuyang Wang and Andrew Crompton and Asterios Agkathidis,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foar.2022.12.004,,,,2095-2635,Frontiers of Architectural Research,"Urban morphology, Siheyuan, Hutong neighbourhood, Procedural modelling, Shape grammar",3.0,458-476,,The Hutong neighbourhood grammar: A procedural modelling approach to unravel the rationale of historical Beijing urban structure,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095263523000031,12.0,2023,,

article,VELENTZA2021104272,"In the years to come social robots will be extensively used in the teaching field. Consequently, it is important to determine how these robots can optimally interact with students. This paper specifically looks at the performance of social robots in place of university professors, in the field of engineering, measuring three outcomes, enjoyment (questionnaire), the acquisition of knowledge (academic test after class and final exam grades) and level of surprise (facial expressions monitored by cameras). Inspired by previous cognitive studies which have evidenced that feelings of surprise and familiarity affect the learning process, the hypothesis of this research is that robot-tutors will increase student's enjoyment. Leading the research to question whether higher levels of enjoyment strongly correlate with a higher acquisition of knowledge through a series of three experiments. Using the same subject material, three variables were tested: 1. one robot-tutor lecture, 2. one human-tutor lecture, 3. two robot-tutor lectures. Initial findings showed that students lectured by a human-tutor once, acquired a higher level of knowledge compared to those lectured by a robot-tutor once. However, those in the robot-tutor lecture shared higher levels of enjoyment as well as increased expressions of surprise. When students were lectured by a robot-tutor for the second time, results showed both a higher level of acquired knowledge and enjoyment and a drop in expressed surprise, compared to both, one human-tutor lecture and one robot-tutor lecture or one robot-tutor lecture.

article,HUANG2022104577,"STEM teachers are critical mediators of knowledge, and their performance can directly impact students' learning experiences and knowledge acquisition. To ensure the quality of STEM instruction, countries worldwide have launched STEM teacher professional development (TPD) programs. It is paramount to know how these programs have been implemented and what lessons can be learned from them. In this study, to capture the trends in publications on K-12 STEM TPD, we systematically reviewed relevant journal papers published in the Web of Science database from 2006 to 2020. We analyzed the (1) knowledge foci, (2) professional development approaches, (3) outcome measurements, as well as (4) data sources of the STEM TPDs. In addition, to inform future professional development designs, we selected and developed narrative descriptions of three exemplary cases. These cases showcased high-quality TPD and covered pre-service and in-service teachers in formal and informal settings. We reviewed the knowledge foci of the STEM TPDs using the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework. The results showed that the types of knowledge delivered in the STEM TPD programs were mostly pedagogical knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge, while a certain number of programs focused on technological content knowledge and technological pedagogical content knowledge. Most of the studies adopted mixed professional development approaches, featuring activities like learning by design, learning by doing, reflective learning, and group work. These approaches emphasized the active participation of teachers in the process, built links between content and classroom practices, and encouraged collective participation in developing expertise. However, the data were mostly collected through interviews or survey instruments. Future research should move beyond analyzing data on teachers’ perceptions to explore processes (e.g., online participation logs, teacher-peer interactions) and products of performance (e.g., lesson plans, handmade crafts) to further examine the effects of STEM TPD activities.

article,RAHIMI2024100258,"There are some dichotomies surrounding ChatGPT's application and impact on education as a central part of artificial intelligence (AI) integration. Problems concerning negative preconceptions and the limited usage of this form of AI have been reported, as some teachers perceive it as a competitor. This is due to insufficient readiness for its integration and a lack of understanding of how it can facilitate teaching innovation. Due to this, the researchers applied a bisymmetric approach, where necessity conditional analysis (NCA) as a symmetrical approach employs necessity logic to identify the must-have factors required for language teachers' passing accountability, while PLS-SEM as an asymmetrical approach follows additive sufficiency logic to identify the should-have factors that contribute to helping them to pass their accountability. Applying this approach would generate more results from different perspectives in ChatGPT readiness and language teaching innovation with it. In this line, the researchers randomly explored 124 Iranian in-service language teachers ChatGPT readiness and their teaching innovation in helping them pass the external and internal language teaching competencies. The result of the PLS-SEM showed that the more the language teachers were ready to practically use ChatGPT alongside, aware of its opportunities and challenges in English language teaching (ELT), the more they could generate more language teaching methods and approaches with it, apply them to their language teaching procedures, and share them with their colleagues. Moreover, their generational language teaching methods with ChatGPT mediated the correlation between ChatGPT readiness and meeting internal accountability. Additionally, the NCA showed that the generation of language teaching methods with ChatGPT and their implementation through it were among the necessary factors that help language teachers meet both internal and external accountability by teaching language with ChatGPT.

article,OPRISAN2022101642,"Developing interdisciplinary undergraduate courses is challenging at all levels; it requires involving trained faculty who can successfully cover more than one discipline and creating a new curriculum that crosses discipline boundaries. While such integrative curricula are expected in a graduate school setting, they are challenging at the undergraduate level since they require proficiency in multiple disciplines. However, making this transition to interdisciplinary, project-based teaching at the undergraduate level gives a competitive edge to undergraduates. As part of a broader effort of developing a comprehensive neuroscience curriculum, we implemented an interdisciplinary, one-semester, upper-level course called Biophysical Modeling of Excitable Cells (BMEC). The course exposes undergraduate students to broad areas of computational biology. It focuses on computational neuroscience, develops scientific literacy, and promotes teamwork between biology, psychology, physics, and mathematics-oriented undergraduates. This course also provides pedagogical experience for senior Ph.D. students in Neuroscience. BMEC is a three contact hours per week lecture-based course that includes a set of computer-based activities designed to gradually increase the undergraduates’ ability to apply mathematics and computational concepts to solving biologically-relevant problems. The class brings together two different groups of students with very dissimilar and complementary backgrounds, i.e., biology/psychology and physics/mathematics oriented. The teamwork allows students with more substantial biology/psychology backgrounds to explain to physics/mathematics students the biological implications and instill realism into the computer modeling project they completed for this class. Simultaneously, students with substantial physics/mathematics backgrounds can apply techniques learned in specialized mathematics, physics, or computer science classes to generate mathematical hypotheses and implement them in computer codes.

Maker-oriented activities have the potential to shed light on types of learning that previous assessment systems have not captured and examined. Nevertheless, little is discussed on how making can contribute to the assessment and instructional practices at large. This case study investigated educators' experiences with assessment in classrooms integrating maker activities. Through a qualitative analysis of interviews with six K-12 educators in Canada, the researchers examined: (1) in what ways does making activities create opportunities for assessment and instruction in K-12 classrooms? (2) in what ways does maker learning become a challenge for assessment and instruction in K-12 classrooms? Our analysis revealed several ways in which teachers experienced the advantages of the making approach for understanding student learning and for helping students become further aware of their own progress.

article,VANDERSTAP2024105103,"Blended learning offers a learner-centred approach that employs both in-class learning and digital technology to facilitate online learning. Such an approach is especially advantageous to adult-learners in higher education as it meets their educational needs.

Literature relating to adult-learners’ educational needs and online interaction was consulted in order to design teaching strategies that foster adult-learners’ online interaction. The aim of this study is to further validate these teaching strategies, hence a multiple case study was carried out using a mixed method approach. As such, eight teachers and sixteen students from four courses across three universities in Belgium and the Netherlands were interviewed. Additionally, a questionnaire testing a pre-defined set of variables was distributed to 84 students.

The findings showed that a majority of programming games presents only a moderate alignment with established instructional principles. Furthermore, significant differences in the presence and prevalence of their game attributes were found. Our analysis resulted in a systematic classification of programming games according to their alignment with instructional principles and their positioning on a playing-versus-programming spectrum.

The Alpha, Beta, and Gamma SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) co-circulated globally during 2020 and 2021, fueling waves of infections. They were displaced by Delta during a third wave worldwide in 2021, which, in turn, was displaced by Omicron in late 2021. In this study, we use phylogenetic and phylogeographic methods to reconstruct the dispersal patterns of VOCs worldwide. We find that source-sink dynamics varied substantially by VOC and identify countries that acted as global and regional hubs of dissemination. We demonstrate the declining role of presumed origin countries of VOCs in their global dispersal, estimating that India contributed <15% of Delta exports and South Africa <1%–2% of Omicron dispersal. We estimate that >80 countries had received introductions of Omicron within 100 days of its emergence, associated with accelerated passenger air travel and higher transmissibility.

With a method called ""gaze-ray casting,"" we simulated 3D-gaze movements to obtain information about the gazed objects. This information was used to create graphical models of visual attention, establishing attention networks. These networks represented participants' gaze transitions between different entities in the VR environment over time. Measures of centrality, distribution, and interconnectedness of the networks were calculated to describe the network structure. The measures, derived from graph theory, allowed for statistical inference testing and the interpretation of participants' visual attention in 3D VR environments.

article,MOREIRA2023102107,"Climate change calls for action from all sectors of our global economy, including ICT. Therefore, it is important to change the way we develop software to address the challenges posed by sustainability. Our goal is to contribute with a reusable sustainability requirements catalogue that helps developers be aware of sustainability-related properties worth considering during software development. The information for this catalogue was gathered via a systematic mapping study, whose results were synthesised in feature models and then modelled using iStar for a more expressive and configurable representation. A qualitative evaluation of the catalogue’s readability, interest, utility, and usefulness by 50 participants from the domain, showed that around 79% of the respondents found the catalogue “Good” or “Very Good”. However, more than 5% of the expert participants found weaknesses regarding most of the evaluated questions and around 25% are neutral in their overall evaluation. This led us to evolve the initial version of the catalogue for the social and technical dimensions of sustainability to improve its completeness and usefulness. This is achieved by aligning the information gathered in the systematic mapping study with the well-established quality model of the ISO/IEC 25010:2011, as we expect most of the experts are familiar with those qualities and respective hierarchies. During this process, we found information that led us to propose two additional qualities that were not covered by the ISO standard: fairness and legislation.

Professional developers of parallel software think in terms of parallel design patterns, which are markedly different from traditional (sequential) design patterns. It follows that the more we can teach students to think in terms of parallel patterns, the more their thinking will resemble that of parallel software professionals. In this paper, we present patternlets—minimalist, scalable, syntactically correct programs, each designed to introduce students to a particular parallel design pattern. The collection currently includes 44 patternlets (16 MPI, 17 OpenMP, 9 Pthreads, and 2 heterogeneous), of which we present a representative sample.

This is because simulation is safer, less expensive, and faster than field implementation and experimenting. To achieve high fidelity and credibility in conducting prediction and exploration of the actual system with simulation models, a rigorous calibration and validation procedure should firstly be applied. However, one of the key issues in calibration is the acquisition of valid source information from the target system. The aim of this study is to develop a systematic method to automatically calibrate a general emergency department model with incomplete data. The simulation-based optimization was used to search for the best value of model parameters.

The two primary goals of this study were to (a) examine the factor structure of a parent-report measure of home science interactions and (b) evaluate how these factors relate to the science core knowledge of young children from families with low incomes. A total of 125 families with children aged 3 to 5 years (52 girls) participated in the study. Children were assessed on a measure of science core knowledge, and parents completed a brief questionnaire on their home science interactions that included questions pertaining to both home science disciplinary core idea (DCI) engagement and home science and engineering practice (SEP) engagement. Findings revealed that although separating home science interactions into distinct DCI and SEP factors represented the data well, the best overall representation of home science interactions was a one-factor model that included only home DCI engagement items.

article,COURTNEYMUSTAPHI201977,"Radiometric dating methods are essential for developing geochronologies to study Late Quaternary environmental change and 210Pb dating is commonly used to produce age-depth models from recent (within 150 years) sediments and other geoarchives. The past two centuries are marked by rapid environmental socio-ecological changes frequently attributed to anthropogenic land-use activities, modified biogeochemical cycles, and climate change. Consequently, historical reconstructions over this recent time interval have high societal value because analyses of these datasets provide understanding of the consequences of environmental modifications, critical ecosystem thresholds, and to define desirable ranges of variation for management, restoration, and conservation. For this information to be used more broadly, for example to support land management decisions or to contribute data to regional analyses of ecosystem change, authors must report all of the useful age-depth model information. However, at present there are no guidelines for researchers on what information should be reported to ensure 210Pb data are fully disclosed, reproducible, and reusable; leading to a plethora of reporting styles, including inadequate reporting that reduces potential reusability and shortening the data lifecycle. For example, 64% of the publications in a literature review of 210Pb dated geoarchives did not include any presentation of age uncertainty estimates in modeled calendar ages used in age-depth models. Insufficient reporting of methods and results used in 210Pb dating geoarchives severely hampers reproducibility and data reusability, especially in analyses that make use of databased palaeoenvironmental data. Reproducibility of data is fundamental to further analyses of the number of palaeoenvironmental data and the spatial coverage of published geoarchives sites. We suggest, and justify, a set of minimum reporting guidelines for metadata and data reporting for 210Pb dates, including an IEDA (Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance), LiPD (Linked Paleo Data) and generic format data presentation templates, to contribute to improvements in data archiving standards and to facilitate the data requirements of researchers analyzing datasets of several palaeoenvironmental study sites. We analyse practices of methods, results and first order interpretation of 210Pb data and make recommendations to authors on effective data reporting and archiving to maximize the value of datasets. We provide empirical evidence from publications and practitioners to support our suggested reporting guidelines. These guidelines increase the scientific value of 210Pb by expanding its relevance in the data lifecycle. Improving quality and fidelity of environmental datasets broadens interdisciplinary use, lengthens the potential lifecycle of data products, and achieves requirements applicable for evidenced-based policy support.",,Colin J. {Courtney Mustaphi} and Janice Brahney and Marco A.

However, it is essential to systematically evaluate such games in order to obtain sound evidence of their impact. Thus, the objective of this article is to present the state of the art on how games for computing education are evaluated. Therefore, we performed a systematic literature review of a sample of 3617 articles from which 112 relevant articles have been identified, describing 117 studies on the evaluation of games for computing education. Based on these studies we analyzed how evaluations are defined (the analysis factors evaluated, research designs, evaluation models/methods used, kind of data collection instruments, etc.), how they have been executed (sample size and replications) and analyzed (data analysis methods used). As a result, we can confirm that most evaluations use a simple research design in which, typically, the game is used and afterwards subjective feedback is collected via questionnaires from the learners. The majority of the evaluations are run with small samples, without replication, using mostly qualitative methods for data analysis. We also observed that most studies do not use a well-defined evaluation model or method. This shows that there is a need for more rigorous evaluations as well as methodological support in order to assist game creators and instructors to improve such games as well as to systematically support decisions on when or how to include them within instructional units.",,Giani Petri and Christiane {Gresse von Wangenheim},,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2017.01.004,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"Evaluation, Educational game, Computing education, Systematic literature review, Computer science",,68-90,,How games for computing education are evaluated?

Our results indicate that children taught by a peer showed comparable overall performance—a combination of accuracy and response times—to their classmates taught by an adult. However, there was a speed–accuracy trade-off, and peer-taught children showed more exploratory behavior, with shorter response times at the expense of lower accuracy. In contrast, no tutor effects (i.e., resulting from teaching a peer) were found.

article,ISMAILOVA2021332,"One of the aims of this work is to revise the known issues of how to obtain the value of the expression using an applicative computing system. Computation and/or symbolic transformations have undoubtedly become one of the dominant trends in modern computer science. In particular, this refers to the execution of the processes of inference of an object with given properties, which is studied with the formation of sets of equalities leading to a target computational model. At the same time, the mathematical theory of computation gets a target equational description, making the process of studying its properties and capabilities more suitable. A model structure based on the method of indexed expressions is developed and applied using the notions of evaluation mapping and assignments. As shown, this may not be considered as generic notion, but derived using the combinators. Thus, the semantics of computation can be derived from the construction of a combinator-as-process. This is the embedding into a system of combinators. A linking system of equalities between combinatorsl is established, which serving as a generic computational model.

article,PRINSLOO2023102901,"The invention of floatovoltaic technologies brought new meaning to the theoretical framing of sustainability as the technology delivers extended natural resource conservation benefits. However, planning assessments for this novel sustainable energy technology exposed knowledge gaps jeopardising global financial investments and regulatory approvals. Knowledge and methodological gaps cause inaccurate performance predictions in current geospatial-engineering modelling tools and fail to adequately quantify the diverse range of layered performance qualities and impacts of floating photovoltaics. This paper advances a geo-sensitive system dynamics framework to systemically integrate the energy, environmental and economic domain object functions in characterising the behaviour and sustainability of floating photovoltaic systems theoretically. The framework serves as computer logic in a geospatial digital twin to synthesise floatovoltaic operations to predict the technology’s sustainability impact and offset attributes in balanced scorecard metrics and water–energy–land–food nexus indicators. Experimental evaluations with the proposed framework in a real-world setting demonstrate the value of the holistically integrated framework in analytical floatovoltaic project appraisal and planning support. The results highlight significant advantages when comparing a 1000 m2 floatovoltaic system with a similar-sized conventional photovoltaic alternative, including a 19.3% lifetime energy gain, a carbon emission displacement of CO2e=5168t and a freshwater evaporation benefit of 983 kL.

article,ULFERTBLANK2022104626,"Today, digitalization is affecting all areas of life, such as education or work. The competent use of digital systems (esp. information and communication technologies [ICT]) has thus become an essential skill. Despite longstanding research on human-technology interaction and diverse theoretical approaches describing competences for interacting with digital systems, research still offers mixed results regarding the structure of digital competences. Self-efficacy is described as one of the most critical determinants of competent digital system use, and various self-report scales for assessing digital self-efficacy have been suggested. Yet, these scales largely differ in their proposed specificity, structure, validation, and timeliness. The present study aims at providing a systematic overview and comparison of existing measures of digital self-efficacy (DSE) to current theoretical digital competence frameworks. Further, we present a newly developed scale that assesses digital self-efficacy in heterogeneous adult populations, theoretically founded in the DigComp 2.1 and social-cognition theory. The factorial structure of the DSE scale is assessed to investigate multidimensionality. Further, the scale is validated considering the nomological network (actual ICT use, technophobia).

Theoretically, the affective domain of coding is in its infancy, and very few studies have set out to identify the determinants of coding interest and self-efficacy. This study explored how mathematics interest and self-efficacy, as two important mathematics-related factors, influenced coding interest and self-efficacy. Employing a quantitative cross-sectional survey design, 605 students from two public senior high schools in two big cities in China were investigated. A two-step structural equation modeling approach was adopted to analyze the data. Findings showed that mathematics interest, directly and indirectly, influenced coding interest significantly. In addition, coding self-efficacy was indirectly impacted by mathematics interest and coding interest was indirectly impacted by mathematics self-efficacy significantly.

While there are numerous potential benefits to using digital tools to enhance democracy, significant challenges must be addressed. It is essential to ensure that digital technologies are used in an accessible, equitable, and fair manner rather than reinforcing existing power imbalances. This paper investigates how digital tools can be used to help design more democratic societies by investigating three key research areas: (1) the role of digital technologies for facilitating civic engagement in collective decision-making; (2) the use of digital tools to improve transparency and accountability in governance; and (3) the potential for digital technologies to enable the formation of more inclusive and representative democracies.

article,LIU2024105109,"In the Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) forum, learning engagement encompasses three fundamental dimensions—cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagement—that intricately interact to jointly influence students' learning achievements. However, the interplay between multiple engagement dimensions and their correlations with learning achievement remain understudied, particularly across different academic disciplines. This study adopts an automated configurational approach that integrates bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore the configurations of learning engagement, their connections with learning achievement, and variations across disciplines. Our analysis reveals a nuanced profile of learners' learning engagement, indicating the high-achieving individuals demonstrated more frequent posting and commenting behaviors and the high-level cognitive engagement than low-achieving individuals. Second, our analysis revealed multiple configurations where the coexistence or absence of factors at different levels of the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional dimensions significantly impacted learning achievement. Learners who conducted posting and replying behaviors, expressed positive emotions, and engaged in deep cognitive engagement tended to achieve superior learning outcomes. Third, there were significant differences in behavioral and emotional engagement among learners across different academic disciplines. Specifically, pure discipline learners were more inclined to engage in posting behaviors than the applied discipline learners. Across academic disciplines, positive emotions correlated strongly with higher achievement.

article,LIANG2023104827,"Digital technology has brought new opportunities for language education. Multimodal literacy refers to the ability to read, watch, understand, respond to, and generate multimodal texts. Multimodality, promoted by scholars, generates meaning in multiple modes. Hence, digital storytelling (DST) presented with multimodal content has been extensively applied in second language instruction. However, traditional DST is mostly presented in videos with one-way communication; it lacks two-way communication with the audience and is only regarded as a learning method for knowledge acquisition. As a result, the present study proposed a robot-based DST (robot-DST) approach to facilitate the interaction in the DST process and to enhance students' engagement. In order to evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experiment was conducted in an EFL course at a senior high school. Two classes of 11th graders participated in the experiment. One class with 40 students was the experimental group adopting the robot-DST approach, while the other class with 40 students was the control group adopting the conventional animation-based DST (CA-DST) approach. The results showed that the robot-DST approach could significantly reduce students' communication apprehension, as well as enhance their English speaking ability, storytelling ability, narrative engagement, and communication tendency.

article,SOSAREYES2022676,"In 2013, the Forensic Science Undergraduate Program (FSUP) at the National Autonomous University of Mexico was created in response to an alarming criminal situation in Mexico, as well as to the radical reform of its criminal justice system. Its mission is to educate and train ethical, critical, and humanistic forensic scientists capable of conducting inquiries that meet scientific quality standards and assist the justice system in firmly linking legal rulings to the available evidence. At the time, it was the first such program in the country, and the contributions that interdisciplinary forensic scientists could make to criminal investigations were largely unknown among forensic and legal practitioners. During its existence, providing an interdisciplinary, competence-based education to students has been one of the main challenges. To overcome it, teaching and assessment approaches—centered on the achievement of specifically forensic competencies as learning outcomes and the integration of forensic disciplines towards the resolution of simulated cases—have been devised to help develop the professional skill set expected of graduates. The COVID-19 pandemic led to adapting these approaches to distance or hybrid modes of learning, increasing their versatility and enriching the pedagogic repertoire of the FSUP. Currently, the main impact of the program lies in the successful incorporation of some of its graduates to agencies belonging to or related to the criminal justice system, such as the National Prosecutor’s Office, the Commission for Truth and Justice for the Ayotzinapa Case, and the National Commission for the Search of Missing and Disappeared Persons, among others.",,Ana María Sosa-Reyes and Alexa Villavicencio-Queijeiro and Luis Jiro Suzuri-Hernández,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scijus.2022.08.006,,,,1355-0306,Science & Justice,"Interdisciplinary, Teaching, Forensic science, Pre-pandemic, Post-pandemic",6.0,676-690,,"Interdisciplinary approaches to the teaching of forensic science in the Forensic Science Undergraduate Program of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, before and after COVID-19",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135503062200106X,62.0,2022,"The Future of Teaching, Training and Learning in Forensic and Crime Sciences",
article,LAI2023100178,"Background
ChatGPT, a powerful artificial intelligence chatbot, has great potential for active learning because of its ability to generate instant responses to academic inquiries and foster spontaneous interactions.
Purpose
This exploratory study investigated the roles of intrinsic motivation and factors of the technology acceptance model that influence ChatGPT acceptance for active learning among undergraduates in Hong Kong.
Method
Using a structural equation modeling approach, we examined the extended technology acceptance model in the context of higher education. Using self-report questionnaires, we obtained useful responses from 473 undergraduate students in Hong Kong in July 2023. The reliability and validity of the data were measured using confirmatory factor analysis, followed by path analysis to investigate the hypotheses in the proposed model.
Results
We identified intrinsic motivation as the strongest motivator for ChatGPT use intention. Consistent with the prior literature on technology acceptance, perceived usefulness was found to be a strong predictor of behavioral intention. In contrast to extant research, the findings indicate no significant relationship between perceived ease of use and behavioral intention. Neither perceived usefulness nor perceived ease of use were significant mediators in the relationship between intrinsic motivation and behavioral intention.
Conclusion
These findings highlight the significant effect of intrinsic motivation on ChatGPT acceptance in supporting students’ active learning. They also provide inspiration for ChatGPT developers and educationalists regarding the importance of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (perceived usefulness) in promoting the broader acceptance of chatbots in the educational context. Efforts should be made to improve students’ positive subjective experiences and the response quality of ChatGPT.",,Chung Yee Lai and Kwok Yip Cheung and Chee Seng Chan,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2023.100178,,,,2666-920X,Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence,"Technology acceptance model, ChatGPT, Intrinsic motivation, Chatbot, Active learning",,100178,,Exploring the role of intrinsic motivation in ChatGPT adoption to support active learning: An extension of the technology acceptance model,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X23000577,5.0,2023,,

article,KINOSHITA201616,"Across the globe, wildfires are increasing in frequency and magnitude under a warming climate, impacting natural resources, infrastructure, and millions of people every year. At the same time, human encroachment into fire-prone areas has increased the potential for ignition, as well as risks and damages to human communities. In an era of intensifying human activities on Earth – the “Anthropocene” – societal interactions with post-fire landscapes are becoming commonplace. Yet, theories regarding post-fire impacts derived from individual disciplines no longer apply in cases where human interactions are intense. A holistic approach that accounts for interactions between natural and human systems is necessary to understand the altered dynamics of post-fire landscapes. Focusing on the intersection of fire, water, and society, this paper explores an integrative research framework to couple post-fire fluvial and human processes. We review trends in wildfires and growing impacts on humans, how fluvial processes and systems are altered by wildfires, and the potential hazards for human settlements. This review forms a basis for integrating societal concerns, such as vulnerability, economic impacts, and management responses. We then link disciplinary questions into broad interdisciplinary research through an integrative framework. The 2012 Waldo Canyon Fire (Colorado, USA) provides an illustrative case with intense human interactions, both during and after the fire, to formulate critical questions within the integrative framework.

article,WILSON201565,"This paper starts from the perspective that the current conceptualization of educational assessment is out of date, but particularly with regard to conception of information and communication (ICT) literacy. We initially provide a brief summary of the idea of a 21st century skill, then trace the conceptual changes in the idea of ICT literacy in four main steps: First, we briefly describe a concentration of knowledge about computers and their use, coalescing into the concept of ICT literacy in the early years of the field. Second, we describe the transition to a view of ICT literacy as a broad set of skills that have links to many traditional and non-traditional school subjects, and the move to technology integration in education. Third, we see the next transition for ICT literacy expressed as progress variables that are essential tools for the design of curriculum and assessments. Fourth, we discuss the impact of the “social network” perspective on ICT literacy—the critical need for building the power of virtual skills through proficiency with networks of people, information, tools, and resources. In summary, we offer a new framework for assessing student ICT learning, based on a learning progression and social networking point of view. Throughout, we use extensive examples to help illustrate our review of the broad sweep of this development, and, as a part of the conclusion, we speculate about the coming next steps.",,Mark Wilson and Kathleen Scalise and Perman Gochyyev,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsc.2015.05.001,,,,1871-1871,Thinking Skills and Creativity,"ICT literacy, Learning in digital communities, Social networks, Social capital, Intellectual capital",,65-80,,Rethinking ICT literacy: From computer skills to social network settings,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187115300080,18.0,2015,21st Century Skills: International Advancements and Recent Developments,
article,CORKIN2022104642,"Digital divides occur when there are inequities in access to the benefits afforded by digital technologies. Originally conceptualised as inequitable access to digital technologies and internet, it is now recognised that the ways in which individuals use digital technologies and the competencies they subsequently develop may also contribute to digital divides. The aims of the current study were twofold. Firstly, to investigate categories of screen media use outside of school for children at age eight, and whether children of this age fall into “user typographies”, whereby different “modes” of digital technology use have already started to emerge. Secondly, to consider the implications of different modes of use at 8 years of age for the establishment of digital divides. Using a sample of 5010 children participating in the Growing Up in New Zealand study, the results of factor analysis indicated six categories of screen-based activities (Social, Creative, Shopping, Educational, Entertainment, and Interests), while four different modes of digital technology use were identified via cluster analysis (Creative, Entertainment, Emergent, and Limited). While Entertainment Users and Creative Users engaged with most activities on a fairly regularly basis, Emergent Users, and in particular, Limited Users, engaged with a narrower range of activities and at lower frequencies.

article,WANG2023100364,"The digitalization of higher education (HE) institutions and relevant issues have attracted the attention of many educational stakeholders. ICT has become a subject of high importance in every context, particularly in the workplace; thus, a principal goal for universities and schools is to prepare future professionals capable of dealing with problems and searching for effective solutions by their digital competence as a key skill. In this regard, a new framework is developed to evaluate the main drivers of digital transformation in higher education institutions (HEIs) in the era of industry 4.0. The developed framework is proposed a decision approach that can effectively use the presented information to make decisions of high rationality. This framework is applied to compute the subjective and objective criteria weights, and it is used to assess the preferences of organizations. An empirical case study to evaluate the main drivers for the implementation of digital transformation in HEIs is taken. According to the findings, the most significant drivers for the implementation of digital transformation in HEIs in the era of Industry 4.0 are developing, updating, and adapting a curriculum (0.0425), integration of digital technologies for universal education (0.0420), and cloud computing (0.0419), respectively. Hence, the evaluation results also show that the option higher education institution (HEI)-4 has the highest overall utility degree (1.845) over different drivers for the implementation of digital transformation in HEIs in the era of Industry 4.0.

Given numerous studies support the positive effects of games on learning, a growing number of researchers are committed to developing educational games to promote students’ 21st century skill development in schools. However, little is known regarding how games may influence student acquisition of 21st century skills. This paper examines the most recent literature in regard to game-based learning and identified 29 studies which targeted 21st century skills as outcomes. The range of game genres and game design elements as well as learning theories used in these studies are discussed, together with the range of indicators, measures and outcomes for impacts on 21st century skills. The findings suggest that a game-based learning approach might be effective in facilitating students’ 21st century skill development.

Relational thinking was evidenced across a range of subtraction calculation skill levels. Those students who could use both indirect addition and take-away strategies flexibly, depending on the size of the numbers involved, were more likely to evidence attention to generality with symbolic equations.

article,LEPRI2021102249,"Summary
Today's increased availability of large amounts of human behavioral data and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are contributing to a growing reliance on algorithms to make consequential decisions for humans, including those related to access to credit or medical treatments, hiring, etc. Algorithmic decision-making processes might lead to more objective decisions than those made by humans who may be influenced by prejudice, conflicts of interest, or fatigue. However, algorithmic decision-making has been criticized for its potential to lead to privacy invasion, information asymmetry, opacity, and discrimination. In this paper, we describe available technical solutions in three large areas that we consider to be of critical importance to achieve a human-centric AI: (1) privacy and data ownership; (2) accountability and transparency; and (3) fairness. We also highlight the criticality and urgency to engage multi-disciplinary teams of researchers, practitioners, policy makers, and citizens to co-develop and evaluate in the real-world algorithmic decision-making processes designed to maximize fairness, accountability, and transparency while respecting privacy.",,Bruno Lepri and Nuria Oliver and Alex Pentland,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102249,,,,2589-0042,iScience,"Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Privacy",3.0,102249,,Ethical machines: The human-centric use of artificial intelligence,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004221002170,24.0,2021,,
article,ZHENG2020103669,"Engineering design is a complex process which requires science, technology, engineering, and mathematic (STEM) knowledge. Students' self-regulation plays a critical role in interdisciplinary tasks. However, there is limited research investigating whether and how self-regulation leads to different learning outcomes among students in engineering design. This study analyzes the engineering design behaviors of 108 ninth-grade U.S. students using principal component analysis and cluster analysis. It classifies the students into four distinct types: competent, cognitive-oriented, reflective-oriented, and minimally self-regulated learners. Competent self-regulated learners perceived themselves as the most self-regulated learners and had the greatest learning gains, although they did not perform best in the task. Cognitive-oriented self-regulated learners perceived themselves as the least self-regulated learners although they were the second best in both the performance of the task and learning gains. In contrast, reflective learners had the best performance in the task. Minimally self-regulated learners did not perform well in the task and had the lowest learning gains. The results revealed that the competent self-regulated learners had an appropriate assessment of themselves to obtain knowledge, cognitive-oriented self-regulated learners underestimated themselves, reflective learners focused on the results of the task, and minimally self-regulated learners overestimated themselves and exerted the least effort. The results also offer new insights into STEM education and self-regulated learning with emerging learning analytics.",,Juan Zheng and Wanli Xing and Gaoxia Zhu and Guanhua Chen and Henglv Zhao and Charles Xie,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103669,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"Self-regulation, STEM learning, Learning analytics, Energy3D, Engineering design",,103669,,Profiling self-regulation behaviors in STEM learning of engineering design,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131519302222,143.0,2020,,
article,LIU20171,"Researchers and educators continuously remark on the importance of integrating creativity into the learning process. This study proposes a creativity approach to facilitating participatory learning for the sustained engagement of young learners based on the principle of remix practice, which consists of learning to generate online artefacts, endless hybridization and scaffolding. This study investigated students' engagement in and perceptions of the creative learning process during a two-year participatory learning program. Data collected included students’ flow perceptions during a 39-week activity, their motivation and creative self-efficacy before and after the intervention, as well as their creative products. The findings indicated that the remix-oriented approach led to a higher level of intrinsic motivation and sustained flow compared to a model-based approach, especially interest and curiosity, in this participatory learning program. The approach also helped the students to perceive a significant increase in their level of creative self-efficacy associated with strategies to generate creative ideas.

It serves as a requirement for every CS major and minor and is a prerequisite to upper-level courses that expand on parallel and distributed computing topics in different contexts. With the addition of this new course, we are able to easily make room in upper-level courses to add and expand parallel and distributed computing topics.

article,RADIANTI2020103778,"Researchers have explored the benefits and applications of virtual reality (VR) in different scenarios. VR possesses much potential and its application in education has seen much research interest lately. However, little systematic work currently exists on how researchers have applied immersive VR for higher education purposes that considers the usage of both high-end and budget head-mounted displays (HMDs). Hence, we propose using systematic mapping to identify design elements of existing research dedicated to the application of VR in higher education. The reviewed articles were acquired by extracting key information from documents indexed in four scientific digital libraries, which were filtered systematically using exclusion, inclusion, semi-automatic, and manual methods. Our review emphasizes three key points: the current domain structure in terms of the learning contents, the VR design elements, and the learning theories, as a foundation for successful VR-based learning. The mapping was conducted between application domains and learning contents and between design elements and learning contents. Our analysis has uncovered several gaps in the application of VR in the higher education sphere—for instance, learning theories were not often considered in VR application development to assist and guide toward learning outcomes. Furthermore, the evaluation of educational VR applications has primarily focused on usability of the VR apps instead of learning outcomes and immersive VR has mostly been a part of experimental and development work rather than being applied regularly in actual teaching. Nevertheless, VR seems to be a promising sphere as this study identifies 18 application domains, indicating a better reception of this technology in many disciplines. The identified gaps point toward unexplored regions of VR design for education, which could motivate future work in the field.",,Jaziar Radianti and Tim A.

article,GONCHAROW2021316,"The NSF/IEEE-TCPP Parallel and Distributed Computing curriculum guidelines released in 2012 (PDC12) represents an effort to bring more parallel computing concepts into early computer science courses. To date, it has been moderately successful, with the inclusion of some PDC topics in the ACM/IEEE Computer Science curriculum guidelines in 2013 (CS13) and mentions of PDC topics in the Computing Curricula 2020. Additionally, some universities in the U.S. and around the world have started to cover some of these topics in early CS courses. Lack of knowledge of or training in PDC topics among instructors, along with the need to align early CS course content with prescribed learning objectives in the curricula, are often cited as hurdles for adoption in early CS courses. There have been attempts at bringing PDC materials, such as textbook chapters, lecture slides, assignments, and demos to assist instructors of early CS classes. However, the effort required on the part of the instructor to figure out what is relevant to a particular class can be daunting. In this work, we contend that simultaneously classifying pedagogical materials against the CS13 and the PDC12 curriculum guidelines can address some of the challenges faced by instructors and can promote broader adoption of PDC materials in early CS courses. We present CS Materials, a system that can be used to categorize pedagogical materials according to well-known and established curricular guidelines. We show that CS Materials can be leveraged 1) by instructors of early CS courses to find materials that are similar to the one that they use but that also cover PDC topics, and 2) by instructors to check the coverage of topics (and gaps) in a course, and 3) by PDC experts to identify topics for which PDC instructional materials do not exist or are insufficient in order to inform development of additional PDC curricular materials.",,Alec Goncharow and Matthew Mcquaigue and Erik Saule and Kalpathi Subramanian and Paula Goolkasian and Jamie Payton,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2021.05.014,,,,0743-7315,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,"cs education, Educational material recommendation, Integrating PDC in Early CS education, Analyzing the state of PDC education",,316-330,,CS-Materials: A system for classifying and analyzing pedagogical materials to improve adoption of parallel and distributed computing topics in early CS courses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074373152100126X,157.0,2021,,

article,RAMNARAIN201465,"This study investigated the perceptions of physical sciences (physics and chemistry) teachers on the implementation of inquiry-based learning at a diversity of high schools in South Africa. The findings show that teachers at all locations of school have a positive perception of inquiry-based learning, with benefits for learners that include the development of experimental skills and making science more enjoyable. However, with regard to inquiry facilitating conceptual understanding, teachers at township and rural schools believe a didactic approach to be more effective than learners doing inquiry, whilst teachers at suburban and urban schools favour an inquiry-based approach in this regard. The significance of this study is that the lack of resources, large classes, and the limited exposure to inquiry of learners at township and rural schools constrain the implementation of inquiry-based learning at these schools, and result in teachers at such schools resorting to a didactic pedagogy.",,Umesh Dewnarain Ramnarain,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tate.2013.11.003,,,,0742-051X,Teaching and Teacher Education,"Inquiry-based learning, Practical work, School science curriculum, Economically disadvantaged schools",,65-75,,"Teachers' perceptions of inquiry-based learning in urban, suburban, township and rural high schools: The context-specificity of science curriculum implementation in South Africa",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742051X13001753,38.0,2014,,
incollection,GAASEDELEN2019201,"Today, in medicine, performing a procedure on a human requires complex anatomical and physiological knowledge, including 3D relational and physical properties. All commonly employed imaging modalities attempt to recapitulate this information in some useable form. Each technique, however, can only retrieve a small slice of spatial, temporal, or conceptual knowledge of the body area of interest. Furthermore, in some cases like computed tomography, a large amount of information is gathered without a clear strategy for manual or automated analysis. Current software developments are slowly realizing a convergence of medical imaging methodologies toward one of greater realism. For the purposes of this chapter, this “coming together” of disciplines will be delineated as the field of 3D graphics. Although this is a simplification, 3D graphics will be the primary foundation for a much larger hybridized field whose aim will be the creation of informative and accurate medical spatial representations. To understand how this will affect the clinical fields, we will need to first explore 3D graphics more holistically, delving into areas of physical simulation, 3D movie rendering, video game development, and the expansion of 3D visualization hardware. As we explore these fields, we will relate each of these subdomains to analogous examples in the medical field, also documenting opportunities for commercialization and innovation.",,Erik N.

It also offers new ways of considering educational futures including implications for the theoretical understanding of creativity within VLEs. We report on the theoretical development of the concept of WHC within C2Learn, a three-year project designing a digital gaming environment that provides children and young people with multiple opportunities to engage in co-creativity to foster their WHC. C2Learn is the first time WHC has actively been conceptualised in a digital context. We present our over-arching co-creativity conceptual framework which has been developed to frame the specific kind of co-creativity that is envisaged within C2Learn’s VLE. Drawing on that framework, we present a co-creativity assessment methodology specifically focused on evaluating the presence of WHC. We argue that leveraging WHC within VLEs broadens perspectives on the purposes of education, as this ethically framed creativity foregrounds the role of values in generating fundamental small-scale creative change through ‘journeys of becoming’ that have the potential to generate ‘quiet revolutions’ or small cumulative, incremental changes over time which are meaningful to a particular community.",,Chris Walsh and Kerry Chappell and Anna Craft,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsc.2017.01.001,,,,1871-1871,Thinking Skills and Creativity,"Creativity, Wise humanising creativity (WHC), CLearn, Co-creativity, Gameful learning design (GLD)",,228-241,,A co-creativity theoretical framework to foster and evaluate the presence of wise humanising creativity in virtual learning environments (VLEs),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187117300056,24.0,2017,,

article,MACIASMACIAS2023106909,"Speech imagery has been successfully employed in developing Brain–Computer Interfaces because it is a novel mental strategy that generates brain activity more intuitively than evoked potentials or motor imagery. There are many methods to analyze speech imagery signals, but those based on deep neural networks achieve the best results. However, more research is necessary to understand the properties and features that describe imagined phonemes and words. In this paper, we analyze the statistical properties of speech imagery EEG signals from the KaraOne dataset to design a method that classifies imagined phonemes and words. With this analysis, we propose a Capsule Neural Network that categorizes speech imagery patterns into bilabial, nasal, consonant-vocal, and vowels/iy/ and/uw/. The method is called Capsules for Speech Imagery Analysis (CapsK-SI). The input of CapsK-SI is a set of statistical features of EEG speech imagery signals. The architecture of the Capsule Neural Network is composed of a convolution layer, a primary capsule layer, and a class capsule layer.

To address this challenge, we examined in detail the interaction between digital features and autistic children’s joint engagement in a real-world setting, exploring the impact of tangible constraints in fostering social interaction. The current study observed autistic children (aged between 12 and 15 years) playing with a digital robotic toy and a non-digital counterpart, and measured social attention and engagement during free play.

article,WEINTROP201883,"There is growing diversity in the design of introductory programming environments. Where once all novices learned to program in conventional text-based languages, today, there exists a growing ecosystem of approaches to programming including graphical, tangible, and scaffolded text environments. To date, relatively little work has explored the relationship between the design of novice programming environments and the programming practices they engender in their users. This paper seeks to shed light on this dimension of learning to program through the careful analysis of novice programmers’ experiences learning with a hybrid block/text programming environment. Specifically, this paper is concerned with how novices leverage the various affordances designed into programming environments and programming languages to support their early efforts to author programs. We explore this relationship through the construct of modality using data from a study conducted in a high school computer science classroom in which students spent five weeks working in block-based, text-based, and hybrid block/text programming environments. This paper uses a detailed vignette of a novice writing a program in the hybrid environment as a way to characterize emerging programming practices, then presents analyses of programming trends from the full study population to speak to the generality of the practices identified in the vignette. The analyses focus not only on characterizing authoring strategies but also on identifying patterns in novices’ help-seeking behaviors.

Using an experiment in which a robot and a human teacher were used for teaching computational concepts to a group of K-12 students, the main goal of this paper is not to analyze the scores obtained in the post-test performed, but to focus on the students' attitudes towards robots. In order to do this, a version of the NARS and RAS questionnaires, adapted for children, was used. The analysis of the results of these questionnaires considers differences between age groups and students lectured by a robot vs. a human teacher.

article,KOUTROMANOS2023100028,"The research interest in the use of augmented reality smart glasses (ARSGs) has increased dramatically in recent years as they are utilised in many fields such as medicine and industry, as well as everyday life. This study aims to review the empirical research activity concerning the acceptance of ARSGs in all applicable fields. In total, 21 studies published from 2015 to 2022 have been reviewed. Their relative field, theoretical framework, methodological design, and the factors that were found to affect the acceptance or use of ARSGs were recorded. It was found that the research focuses more on users acting as consumers of the glasses than on professionals (e.g., doctors, teachers, athletes) using them in a specific field. Also, the majority of the studies base their theoretical framework either entirely or in part on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Moreover, the research models of these studies extend TAM by using various additional variables, such as privacy risk and external influence. Methodologically speaking, most of the studies follow the quantitative approach, without giving the participants the opportunity to interact with the glasses. In addition, the factors which were found to influence the acceptance or use of the glasses are varied and can be categorised as utilitarian, social, personal, risk-related, and technological. This review adds value to the theory of technology acceptance. This is because it is one of the first to address the acceptance or use of ARSGs. Since there is no acceptance model for ARSGs, the findings of this review could lead researchers to propose models for accepting ARSGs in various fields, such as education.",,George Koutromanos and Georgia Kazakou,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cexr.2023.100028,,,,2949-6780,Computers & Education: X Reality,"Augmented and virtual reality, Augmented reality smart glasses, Technology acceptance models, Review",,100028,,Augmented reality smart glasses use and acceptance: Α literature review,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949678023000223,2.0,2023,,

article,FALLOON2019138,"Early research investigated young students' understandings of science concepts using physical equipment, but technological advances now mean there are new options to introduce these ideas, through devices such as iPads and simulations. However, research investigating the use of simulations in early years' science learning is limited. This study applied revisions of Kolb's Experiential Learning theoretical model to determine if age-indicated science simulations were effective for teaching 5 year olds simple circuit building procedures and electricity concepts, and the function of circuit components. It also explored whether their engagement with the simulations provided worthwhile opportunities to exercise higher order capabilities such as reflective thinking and abstraction – skills oftencited in literature as valuable outcomes from older student and adult use of simulations. Findings indicate students developed a solid base of procedural knowledge about constructing different circuits, and functional knowledge about circuit components they applied to different circuit designs. The emergence of tentative, generalised theories about current and the effects of different circuit designs on the performance of resistors - linked to the exercise of reflective and descriptive thinking, were also noted in many students. However, examples were found of some simulations appearing to foster common misconceptions, such as current being ‘consumed’ by resistors – indicating teachers need to be highly vigilant and work closely with students, to ensure accurate understandings are developed. Overall, with appropriate teacher support and careful selection and review, the study concludes simulations can be effective for introducing young students to simple physical science concepts, and for providing them with opportunities to engage in higher order thinking processes.",,Garry Falloon,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2019.03.001,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"Simulations, Young students, Electricity, Circuits, Experiential learning",,138-159,,Using simulations to teach young students science concepts: An Experiential Learning theoretical analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013151930051X,135.0,2019,,

article,YOUNESCARDENAS20171,"Mangrove forests grow in the estuaries of 124 tropical countries around the world. Because in-situ monitoring of mangroves is difficult and time-consuming, remote sensing technologies are commonly used to monitor these ecosystems. Landsat satellites have provided regular and systematic images of mangrove ecosystems for over 30 years, yet researchers often cite budget and infrastructure constraints to justify the underuse this resource. Since 2001, over 50 studies have used Landsat or ASTER imagery for mangrove monitoring, and most focus on the spatial extent of mangroves, rarely using more than five images. Even after the Landsat archive was made free for public use, few studies used more than five images, despite the clear advantages of using more images (e.g. lower signal-to-noise ratios). The main argument of this paper is that, with freely available imagery and high performance computing facilities around the world, it is up to researchers to acquire the necessary programming skills to use these resources. Programming skills allow researchers to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as image acquisition and processing, consequently reducing up to 60% of the time dedicated to these activities. These skills also help scientists to review and re-use algorithms, hence making mangrove research more agile. This paper contributes to the debate on why scientists need to learn to program, not only to challenge prevailing approaches to mangrove research, but also to expand the temporal and spatial extents that are commonly used for mangrove research.",,Nicolás {Younes Cárdenas} and Karen E.

article,STRAWHACKER2020100212,"Biodesign, a speculative and creative offshoot from the field of bioengineering, is an area of STEM that is growing in popularity in education settings, primarily because of its unique interdisciplinary lens that connects STEM disciplinary knowledge and creative design practices. Although this trend is currently limited to middle school, high school, and higher education, prior research suggests that children 5 years and older, may yield long-term gains from exploring developmentally-appropriate concepts from novel STEM fields. Although there is little research on educational technologies or resources to support young children’s curiosity and learning in this novel domain, some research suggests that young children may already be forming preconceptions about genetics and biology (e.g., from popular media). Tangible technologies, which provide children qualitatively new, developmentally appropriate ways to engage with ideas and techniques, have been shown to support children’s engagement with foundational ideas relevant to biodesign, including the engineering design process. By applying developmentally appropriate constraints to our technology development (e.g., through frameworks such as the Positive Technological Development), the research team developed and evaluated a novel tangible technology called CRISPEE to introduce young children to concepts of biology and engineering.

article,SAIKKONEN2021104206,"Digital information skills are prerequisites for success in the information society. Previous research on 21st century skills has shown that digital skills evolve sequentially, building on digital information skills, making them the key to future skills that teachers should acquire and be able to pass on to future generations. In the research on digital skills, shortcomings of bivariate approaches have been widely identified and interest has largely shifted to multivariate methods. However, the development of effective targeted interventions still requires a deeper understanding of the social resources of individuals and the interdependencies of predictors. This study examined the extent to which sociodemographic factors and available resources predict digital information skills and which subgroups emerge as potential targets for interventions, by analysing the interdependence of the predictor variables. The empirical data used in the study consisted of 4988 Finnish teachers' questionnaire responses and performance test results. Utilising the multiple regression analysis, the study found that digital activity and age explain most of the variation in teachers' digital information skills. Their effect was found to be the inverse of each other, with abundant digital activity increasing and age reducing teachers’ mastery of these skills. Digital self-efficacy and in-service training also emerged as promising predictors, highlighting that teachers' information skills are explained more strongly by the available resources than by sociodemographic factors.

However, the teaching and learning of concepts related to size and scale present major challenges because objects at certain scales are unable to be perceived by humans with the naked eye. A potential way to overcome this challenge could be by means of learning strategies coupled with multimedia learning. In this study we propose learning strategies, instantiated by multimedia are for learning tools that may result in improved learning of size and scale cognition based on the FS2C framework. This framework consists of five levels to characterize size and scale cognition and the cognitive processes supporting them. Participants of this quasi-experimental design included 224 undergraduate students who experienced one of three different multimedia for learning tools, and then were assessed through five tasks whose design was based on the FS2C framework. Results suggest that learning strategies prompting students to compare objects of different sizes, may increase their abilities in ordering and classifying objects. Having students to interact with a logarithmic scale may also have increased participant posttest performance scores in the numerical proportional and absolute measurement tasks.

We present a study investigating how a simple play-facilitating cardboard robot becomes a social interface and create meaningful and playful experiences for preschool children. We observed 214 children engaged in free play with the robot. The analysis produced four social interaction themes and five play patterns, illustrating the most salient reactions. The results show that the robot was successful in enabling play and that the children indeed treated the robot both as a social agent, but also as a material object.

We present examples from learning with electronic textiles and locative game design to illustrate the unique problem spaces of materiality and spatiality specific to computational making.

In this study, we examined the change of students’ SRL profiles over time as 108 middle school students designed green buildings in a simulation-based computer-aided design (CAD) environment. We identified three distinct SRL profiles using a longitudinal clustering approach: reflective-oriented, adaptive, and minimally self-regulated learners. In addition, we found that students with different profile memberships differed significantly in their design performance. Specifically, adaptive self-regulated learners outperformed minimally self-regulated learners on design completeness, whereas reflective-oriented self-regulated learners demonstrated higher design efficiency than minimally self-regulated learners.

Machine learning methods and applications integrate large sets of information with the goal of efficient pattern recognition and the capability of leveraging accurate decision making. The objective of this study is to apply machine learning methods to the supervised classification of lithologies using multivariate log parameter data from offshore wells from the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). According to the analysis of the lithologies proposed in the IODP Expeditions and for the application of our methods, the lithologies were divided into four groups. The IODP Expeditions were organized into four templates for better results in analyzing the set of expeditions and practical application of the methods. The templates were submitted to training, validation, and testing by multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The evaluation was randomly divided into training (70%), validation (10%), and testing (20%) using the classification methods as an evaluation of the results. In the results, it was observed that Template1 (IODP Expedition 362) obtained better results with the MLP method, Template2 (IODP Expeditions 354, 355, and 359) and Template3 (IODP Expeditions 354, 355, 359, and 362) obtained better results with the random forest method with greater than 80.00% accuracy. For cross-validation, the random forest method performed well in all scenarios.

article,EIJKHOUT2018120,"Distributed memory programming, typically through the MPI library, is the de facto standard for programming large scale parallelism, with up to millions of individual processes. Its dominant paradigm of Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) programming is different from threaded and multicore parallelism, to an extent that students have a hard time switching models. In contrast to threaded programming, which allows for a view of the execution with central control and a central repository of data, SPMD programming has a symmetric model where all processes are active all the time, with none privileged, and where data is distributed. This model is counterintuitive to the novice parallel programmer, so care needs to be taken how to instill the proper ‘mental model’. Adoption of an incorrect mental model leads to broken or inefficient code. We identify problems with the currently common way of teaching MPI, and propose a structuring of MPI courses that is geared to explicit reinforcing the symmetric model.

Although it is not as popular as before, from time to time we still find crowds of players gathered in some spots where Pokémon appear. Numerous reports have explored this Pokémon phenomenon; however, the exact reasons for its popularity remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to explore the post-adoption behavior of Pokémon Go players and its influential factors in the gaming and tourism industries. The theoretical model of stimulus-organism-response was drawn on to examine the impact of the environmental stimuli (social influence and media influence) on players’ internal organisms, which in turn affect their post-experience responses. Moreover, gender differences were also examined in the hypothetical relationships. A total of 342 valid questionnaires from actual gamers were collected in this study, and data analysis was performed using a structural equation model. The results show that stimulus effects, such as social stimuli (critical mass and social interaction) and media stimuli (content timeliness and media richness), have significant impacts on the players’ internal gamified experience (attachment and conformity), which in turn affect their visit intention to catch creatures at certain attractions and to continue playing Pokémon Go. Further, we have also found that players’ intention to visit Pokémon spots is significantly correlated with their intention to continue playing the game.

L’analyse cognitive est le fruit d’une réflexion utilisant, entre autres, les principes de la pensée informatique (mathématique, logique et algorithmique) pour repenser des connaissances et des techniques de plusieurs domaines de la psychologie cognitive, de la psychologie sociale, de la psychologie des émotions et de la psychologie de la communication en vue de la formation pédagogique des enseignants d’université. Avant de présenter l’analyse cognitive, je vais rappeler comment l’histoire du calcul depuis 5000 ans peut être vue comme une tentative (réussie) de comprendre, formaliser et automatiser le traitement humain de l’information, thème sur lequel se retrouvent l’informatique et la psychologie. Puis, je montrerai qu’un nouveau comportementalisme, basé sur le comportement numérique mais aussi sur les comportements classiques et sur les zones du cerveau, est en train d’émerger et qu’il produit des modèles psychologiques qui sont utilisés pour connaître les pensées et les intentions des personnes observées, pour mieux leur vendre des objets et pour prédire leurs actions par exemple ; une psychologie numérique émerge. Bien que chacun d’entre nous utilise son ordinateur portable et internet comme une extension de son esprit (lire « Petite Poucette » de Michel Serres), nous n’avons pas encore intégré explicitement la pensée informatique. Nous expliciterons donc quelques éléments de la pensée informatique et nous présenterons enfin l’analyse cognitive en soulignant comment elle utilise à la fois la pensée informatique et des connaissances de psychologie.

The aim is pedagogy training for university teachers. Before explaining what cognitive analysis is, I will tell you how the history of calculation since 5000 years may be seen as a (successful) stab at understanding, formalizing and automating human processing of data, which is where computer science and psychology meet. Then, I will demonstrate that a new behavioralism, based on digital and classical behavior and specific areas of the brain, is starting to emerge and produces psychological models that are used to know the thoughts and intents of the people observed, to better sell them stuff and predict their actions. A digital psychology emerges. Although all of us use a laptop and Internet as an extension of our minds (read “Petite Poucette” by Michel Serres), the digital thought remains implicit.

article,PROFETA2018111,"Explanation of how goal-directed movements are made manifest is the ultimate aim of the field classically referred to as “motor control”. Essential to the sought-after explanation is comprehension of the supporting functional architecture. Seven decades ago, the Russian physiologist and movement scientist Nikolai A. Bernstein proposed a hierarchical model to explain the construction of movements. In his model, the levels of the hierarchy share a common language (i.e., they are commensurate) and perform complementing functions to bring about dexterous movements. The science of the control and coordination of movement in the phylum Craniata has made considerable progress in the intervening seven decades. The contemporary body of knowledge about each of Bernstein’s hypothesized functional levels is both more detailed and more sophisticated. A natural consequence of this progress, however, is the relatively independent theoretical development of a given level from the other levels. In this essay, we revisit each level of Bernstein’s hierarchy from the joint perspectives of (a) the ecological approach to perception-action and (b) dynamical systems theory. We review a substantial and relevant body of literature produced in different areas of study that are accommodated by this ecological-dynamical version of Bernstein’s levels.

article,LAW2021100321,"In the past two decades, we have witnessed soaring efforts in applying Augmented Reality (AR) technology in education.

article,STEPHENS2021103466,"Human activities have extensively altered landscapes throughout the world and further changes are expected in the future. Anthropogenic impacts such as land use change, groundwater extraction and dam construction, along with the effects of climate change, interact with natural factors including soil weathering and erosion. Together, these processes create a constantly shifting, dynamic terrestrial environment that violates the assumption of stationarity commonly applied in hydrology. Consequently, hydrologists need to rethink both statistical and calibrated models to account for complex environmental processes. We review the literature on human-landscape-hydrological interactions to identify processes and feedbacks that influence water balances. Most of the papers covered consider only a few of these processes at a time and focus on structural attributes of the interactions rather than the short and long-term dynamics. We identify challenges in representing the scale-dependence, environmental connectivity and human-water interactions that characterize complex, dynamic landscapes. A synthesis of the findings posits connections between different landscape changes, as well as the associated timescales and level of certainty. A case study explores how different processes could combine to drive long-term shifts in catchment behavior. Recognizing that some important questions remain unaddressed by traditional approaches, we suggest the concept of ‘big laboratories’ in which multifaceted experiments are conducted in the environment by artificially inducing landscape change. These experiments would be accompanied by mechanistic modeling to both untangle experimental results and improve the theoretical basis of environmental models. An ambitious program of physical and virtual experimentation is needed to progress hydrologic prediction for dynamic landscapes.
Plain language summary
The Earth’s surface is constantly changing due to human-driven and natural processes. Shifts may be driven by humans directly (e.g. via land use change) or indirectly (e.g. by driving climate change that causes shifts in ecological communities). Other changes are natural, such as certain soil processes that lead to shifts in texture and properties over time. In many places, landscape change is now occurring at unprecedented rates. This impacts the water cycle, creating a need for models that are robust under changing conditions. Our paper synthesizes a wide range of literature on key aspects of landscape change that have wide-ranging implications for hydrology. We focus on the impacts of processes at different spatial and temporal scales, along with feedbacks between various environmental and anthropogenic shifts. We discuss connections between different landscape changes and the timescales over which they each affect the water cycle. A case study is presented to highlight the potential for cascading landscape disturbances that could alter long-term catchment response. Recognizing limitations in traditional data collection and modeling, we introduce the concept of ‘big laboratories’ to conduct environmental experiments under landscape change, providing an avenue for addressing the complex questions around hydrology in a changing world.",,C.M.

Mirror neurons may serve action recognition in monkeys as well as humans, whereas their putative role in imitation and language may be realized in human but not in monkey.

incollection,CARETTE202215,"Our main models of computation (the Turing Machine and the RAM) and most modern computer architectures make fundamental assumptions about which primitive operations are realizable on a physical computing device. The consensus is that these primitive operations include logical operations like conjunction, disjunction and negation, as well as reading and writing to a large collection of memory locations. This perspective conforms to a macro-level view of physics and indeed these operations are realizable using macro-level devices involving thousands of electrons. This point of view is however incompatible with computation realized using quantum devices or analyzed using elementary thermodynamics as both these fundamental physical theories imply that information is a conserved quantity of physical processes and hence of primitive computational operations. Our aim is to redevelop foundational computational models in a way that embraces the principle of conservation of information. We first define what information is and what its conservation means in a computational setting. We emphasize the idea that computations must be reversible transformations on data. One can think of data as modeled using topological spaces and programs as modeled by reversible deformations of these spaces. We then illustrate this idea using three notions of data and their associated reversible computational models. The first instance only assumes unstructured finite data, i.e., discrete topological spaces. The corresponding notion of reversible computation is that of permutations. We show how this simple model subsumes conventional computations on finite sets. We then consider a modern structured notion of data based on the Curry–Howard correspondence between logic and type theory. We develop the corresponding notion of reversible deformations using a sound and complete programming language for witnessing type isomorphisms and proof terms for commutative semirings. We then “move up a level” to examine spaces that treat programs as data, which is a crucial notion for any universal model of computation. To derive the corresponding notion of reversible programs between programs, i.e., reversible program equivalences, we look at the “higher dimensional” analog to commutative semirings: symmetric rig groupoids. The coherence laws for these groupoids turn out to be exactly the sound and complete reversible program equivalences we seek. We conclude with some possible generalizations inspired by homotopy type theory and survey several open directions for further research.",,Jacques Carette and Roshan P.

This article applies a systematic review methodology in line with the PRISMA protocol and analyzes current social and technological challenges based on 105 articles published between 2000 and 2019. The review identifies social challenges that facilitate personalization for external factors and teaching methods, stimulate learner-oriented content, instructor, peer, and technology forms of engagement, and boost interactivity depending on the willingness of learners and instructors. The review also finds technological challenges that concern designing learning environments and integrating intelligent systems, analytical tools and analysis, system models and ontology, and mobile and social media applications. The review suggests areas for future research involving smart classroom design for continuity and consistency, quality attributes of smart classrooms, efficiency and sustainability of smart classroom infrastructure, and the development of a smart classroom modelling language.",,Aisha M.

article,REISENZEIN20096,"Describes the outlines of a computational explication of the belief–desire theory of emotion, a variant of cognitive emotion theory. According to the proposed explication, a core subset of emotions including surprise are nonconceptual products of hardwired mechanisms whose primary function is to subserve the monitoring and updating of the central representational system of humans, the belief–desire system. The posited emotion-producing mechanisms are analogous to sensory transducers; however, instead of sensing the world, they sense the state of the belief–desire system and signal important changes in this system, in particular the fulfillment and frustration of desires and the confirmation and disconfirmation of beliefs. Because emotions represent this information about the state of the representational system in a nonconceptual format, emotions are nonconceptual metarepresentations. It is argued that this theory of emotions provides for a deepened understanding of the role of emotions in cognitive systems and solves several problems of psychological emotion theory.",,Rainer Reisenzein,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogsys.2008.03.001,,,,1389-0417,Cognitive Systems Research,"Emotion, Belief–desire theory, Metacognition, Affective computing, BDI",1.0,6-20,,Emotions as metarepresentational states of mind: Naturalizing the belief–desire theory of emotion,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389041708000272,10.0,2009,Modeling the Cognitive Antecedents and Consequences of Emotion,
article,HORVATH2015161,"As a novel computational approach, ubiquitous computing was emerging at the beginning of the 1980s and has reached a rather mature level by now. It assumes that computing can be available anywhere, anytime and in any context due to technological developments, social demands and calm implementations. Over the years, the opportunities of this computing paradigm have been explored and the benefits have been exploited successfully in many application fields. This survey paper addresses ubiquitous computing from the perspective of enabling computer aided design. The specific objectives of the reported survey are to: (i) give an overall account of the current status of ubiquitous computing and technologies, (ii) cast light on how ubiquitous computing has influenced the development of CAD systems, tools, and methods, and (iii) critically investigate future development opportunities of ubiquitous computing enabled computer aided design. First, the paper discusses the principles and typical technologies of ubiquitous computing. Then, the development and spectrum of the so-called standard computer aided design tasks are analyzed from a computational point of view. Afterwards, the already implemented design enabling functionalities are discussed and some additional functional possibilities are considered. The literature provides evidence that ubiquitous computing has not managed to revolutionize the methodologies or the systems of computer aided design so far, though many researchers intensively studied the affordances and the application possibilities of ubiquitous technologies. One reason is that ubiquitous computing technologies had in the last two decades to compete with other kinds of computational technologies, such as high-capacity computing, high-speed networking, immersive virtual reality, knowledge ontologies, smart software agents, mobile communication, etc., which had a much stronger influence on the development of computer aided design methods and systems. In combination with the rather conservative and conventionalist industrial practice of CAD system development and application, this may explain why the ubiquitous computing revolution remained weak in computer aided design. The literature clearly indicates that application of ubiquitous technologies did not lead to radically new functionalities that could have been exploited by the concerned industries. Consequently, it seems to be possible that computer aided design simply steps over the paradigm of ubiquitous computing and expects new functionalities from the emerging new computing paradigms, such as brain–computer interfacing, cyber–physical computing, biological computing, or quantum computing.",,Imre Horváth and Regine W.

Model-driven approaches are increasingly used in different domains, such as education, finance and app development, in order to involve non-developers in the software development process. Such tools are hugely dependent on visual elements and thus might not be accessible for users with specific challenges, e.g., visual impairments.
Objectives:
To locate and analyse existing literature on the accessibility of low-code approaches, their strengths and weaknesses and key directions for future research.
Methods:
We carried out a systematic literature review and searched through five leading databases for primary studies. We used both quantitative and qualitative methods for data synthesis.
Results:
After reviewing and filtering 918 located studies, and conducting both backward and forward snowballing, we identified 38 primary studies that were included in our analysis. We found most papers focusing on accessibility of visual languages and block-based programming.
Conclusion:
Limited work has been done on improving low code programming environment accessibility. The findings of this systematic literature review will assist researchers and developers in understanding the accessibility issues in low-code approaches and what has been done so far to develop accessible approaches.",,Hourieh Khalajzadeh and John Grundy,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2024.107570,,,,0950-5849,Information and Software Technology,"Systematic literature review, Low-code, Visual languages, Block-based programming, Accessibility",,107570,,Accessibility of low-code approaches: A systematic literature review,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584924001757,177.0,2025,,

article,LEECULTURA2022100355,"Motion-Based Learning Technologies (MBLT) offer a promising approach for integrating play and problem-solving behaviour within children’s learning. The proliferation of sensor technology has driven the field of learning technology towards the development of tools and methods that may benefit from the produced Multi-Modal Data (MMD). Such data can be used to uncover cognitive, affective and physiological processes during learning activities. Combining MMD with more traditionally exercised assessment tools, such as video content analysis, provides a more holistic understanding of children’s learning experiences and has the potential to enable the design of educational technologies capable of harmonising children’s cognitive, affective and physiological processes, while promoting appropriately balanced play and problem-solving efforts. However, the use of an MMD mixed methods approach that combines qualitative and MMD data to understand children’s behaviours during engagement with MBLT is rather unexplored. We present an in-situ study where 26 children, ages 10–12, solved a motion-based sorting task for learning geometry. We continuously and unobtrusively monitored children’s learning experiences using MMD collection via eye-trackers, wristbands, Kinect joint tracking, and a web camera. We devised SP3, a novel observational scheme that can be used to understand children’s solo interactions with MBLT, and applied it to identify and extract children’s evoked play and problem-solving behaviour. Collective analysis of the MMD and video codes provided explanations of children’s task performance through consideration of their holistic learning experience. Lastly, we applied predictive modelling to identify the synergies between various MMD measurements and children’s play and problem-solving behaviours. This research sheds light on the opportunities offered in the confluence of video coding (a traditional method in learning sciences) and MMD (an emerging method that leverages sensors proliferation) for investigating children’s behaviour with MBLT.",,Serena Lee-Cultura and Kshitij Sharma and Michail Giannakos,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcci.2021.100355,,,,2212-8689,International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction,"Multimodal data, MMLA, Learning Analytics, Sensors, Cognitive Load Theory, Educational Technologies, Embodied Interaction, Multi-Modal mixed methods approach",,100355,,Children’s play and problem-solving in motion-based learning technologies using a multi-modal mixed methods approach,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212868921000647,31.0,2022,,
incollection,WANG2021157,"With the large-scale promotion of new energy vehicles, the demand for power batteries such as the lithium-ion type has increased. Its service lifespan is closely related to the service condition. The important embodiment of the service condition is the battery state of charge, which can reflect its residual capacity. Through accurate residual capacity, the battery application strategy can be planned to realize the battery operation of the best condition. The long service lifespan can be realized by adjusting the voltage and current. Therefore, real-time accurate state estimation has a significant effect on battery management. The extended Kalman filtering algorithm is introduced to estimate the state value under complex working conditions. The overview of the state-of-charge estimation is first conducted. After that, the equivalent modeling construction method is explored. The coordinate transformation treatment is implemented in the binary iterative calculation algorithm, according to which the algorithm is implemented. In the extended calculation process, the iterative prediction and correction strategies are introduced into the test.

article,BARFAR2021113442,"Companies like Ritz Carlton, Disney and Verizon are among many who have invested in analytics to improve their customers' service experiences with the firms. Extensive data are collected on all aspects of how customers interact or experience the products or services. Research has shown the importance of the “peak-end” rule in service design; that is, providing a customer with good “peak” service levels and “ending” the service experience with high quality can enhance customer satisfaction and build loyalty. However, previous studies have examined this phenomenon only in contexts with unidimensional service levels. We introduce peak cubes, which enable service designers and scholars to pinpoint prominent service levels in multidimensional service experience profiles—thereby extending current research on behavioral economics and service design to more general settings. Results indicate the potential of multidimensional peak-end models to better predict customer satisfaction in various service scenarios. Using Shapley values in coalitional game theory, the resulting models can also inform service designers about the quality dimensions that are critical from the perspective of multidimensional peak-end heuristic and customer satisfaction.

While systematic review and meta-analysis studies have synthesized the evidence of this impact, most of them did not differentiate how AR may foster various learning outcomes to different degrees. In this study, 134 (quasi-)experimental studies on augmented reality (AR) in education from 2012 to 2021 were reviewed to discern the impact of AR on three levels of learning outcomes, namely response, knowledge and skill, and performance. The 134 studies are the data of this study for meta-analysis, which were obtained following the procedure of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis. Moreover, meta-regression was employed to investigate important factors relating to the variation of the impact, including educational level, subject area, treatment duration, and AR affordance. Findings from the meta-analysis suggest that AR technology has benefited all three learning outcomes, with a larger mean effect size on the outcome of performance. Furthermore, the meta-regression results indicate treatment duration as a significant factor likely relating to the variation in the impact of AR in education. Moreover, AR used to support the learning of languages or social studies is likely associated with higher positive learner responses such as learning motivation or attitude than AR used for science learning.

This paper presents a framework of employee skills and competencies useful for developing occupational profiles for employees of companies transitioning towards Industry 4.0. The paper consists of a discussion of the theoretical and practical parts of case studies. The theoretical portion was created on the basis of a review of scientific literature and research studies regarding the competencies and skills of employees in the ongoing fourth industrial revolution. This part focuses on the skills profile of an Industry 4.0 employee and an Operator 4.0 (O4.0) from a creativity and innovativeness point of view. The link between the theoretical part and the case study analysis was a general framework for building the competencies and skills of the steelworker in the emerging fourth industrial revolution. The case study analysis covered the framework of competencies and skills of a metallurgist in smart manufacturing built into the organization of steel mills. Recruitment offers of a steel company implementing smart manufacturing (SM) projects and educational programmes of technical universities in the field of metallurgy were analysed. The aim of the study was to develop a framework for the profile of an employee working in an innovative company transforming to I4.0. The publication posed the following research questions (purposes/hypotheses): P1. To what extent do Polish companies in the metallurgical sector pay attention to creativity and innovation issues when looking for employees? P2. To what extent do the profile (portfolio) of metallurgy graduates of Polish technical universities turn their attention to the issues related to creativity and innovation?",,Bożena Gajdzik and Radosław Wolniak,,https://doi.org/10.3390/joitmc8020068,,,,2199-8531,"Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity","Industry 4.0 (I4.0), skills, education, steel sector, innovativeness, creativity, open innovation",2.0,68,,Smart Production Workers in Terms of Creativity and Innovation: The Implication for Open Innovation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2199853122000099,8.0,2022,,
article,ROBSON2022101018,"What would it take to build a computer physician that can take its place amongst human peers? Currently, Neural Nets, especially as so-called “Deep Learning” nets, dominate what is popularly called “Artificial Intelligence”, but to many critics they seem to be little more than powerful data-analytic tools inspired by some of the more basic functions and regions of the human brain such as those involved in early processes in biological vision, classification, and categorization. The deeper nature of human intelligence as the term is normally meant, including relating to consciousness, has been the domain of philosophers, psychologists, and some neuroscientists. Now, attention is turning to neuronal mechanisms in humans and simpler organisms as a basis of a truer AI with far greater potential. Arguably, the approach required should be rooted in information theory and algorithmic science. But as discussed in this paper, caution is required: “just any old information” might not do. The information might need to be of a particular dynamical and actioning nature, and that might significantly impact the kind of computation and computer hardware required. Overall, however, the authors do not favor emergent properties such as those based on complexity and quantum effects.

article,WAITE2020103838,"Teachers in England are required to ensure that learners from the age of five are taught about algorithms and program design. Yet, there is evidence that despite teachers reporting that design is important, they are not converting this into classroom practice. This paper describes a survey study, in which we explored teachers’ difficulties in using design. We surveyed 207 teachers asking them free-text questions on their use of design in teaching programming and their views of pupils’ responses to using design. In the survey, we also investigated teachers’ understanding of the term algorithm, an essential concept which may be a contributing factor in their difficulties with design. We provide underpinning data on the difficulties of using design that teachers of pupils aged from 5 to 11 years old (Grades K to 5) have in teaching programming. Difficulties with design identified include pupil resistance, a lack of time, a lack of pupil and teacher expertise, conflicting pedagogical choices and a general confusion over what an algorithm is. There were statistically significant differences in selection of the term ‘algorithm’ to describe programming artefacts whether a teacher was a specialist or a generalist, what training they had received on programming or design, the age group taught and programming language used. Teachers were more likely to call a complex code snippet an ‘algorithm’ than a simpler one and more likely to select the term to describe code snippets than a design artefact. We make suggestions of how to alleviate the problems including that teachers are introduced to the idea of ambiguous representations of algorithms and a process which refines the representation from ambiguous to unambiguous as the design progresses.",,Jane Waite and Paul Curzon and William Marsh and Sue Sentance,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103838,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"K-5 computing education, Teachers, Design, Programming",,103838,,Difficulties with design: The challenges of teaching design in K-5 programming,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131520300385,150.0,2020,,
article,CANNAVO2020102450,"The introduction of interactive assets in public exhibitions is capable to significantly enhance the visitors’ user experience. However, the creation of interactive applications could represent a challenging task, especially for users lacking computer skills. Visual programming languages (VPLs) – one of the instruments belonging to the broad categories of methods and tools devised to support end-user development (EUD) – promise to offer an intuitive way to overcome these limitations, by providing easy-to-use and efficient interfaces for encoding applications’ logic. Moving from these considerations, this paper first analyses pros and cons of tools devised so far to support the generation of interactive contents. Then, it presents the design of a new tool named Visual Scene Editor (VSE), which allows users with little to no programming skills to create 3D interactive applications by combining available assets through an interactive, visual process. Both objective and subjective measurements have been collected with both skilled and unskilled users to evaluate the performance of the proposed tool. A comparison with existing solutions shows a reduction in the time required to complete the assigned tasks, of the complexity of the logic created, as well as of the number of errors made, confirming the suitability of the VSE for the said purpose.",,Alberto Cannavò and Francesco De Pace and Federico Salaroglio and Fabrizio Lamberti,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2020.102450,,,,1071-5819,International Journal of Human-Computer Studies,"End-user development (EUD), Visual programming languages (VPLs), Interactive assets, 3D Graphics, Virtual reality (VR), Augmented reality (AR), Human-machine interaction (HMI), Natural user interfaces (NUIs)",,102450,,A visual editing tool supporting the production of 3D interactive graphics assets for public exhibitions,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581920300525,141.0,2020,,
article,WEINTROP2019103646,"Block-based programming languages are becoming increasingly common in introductory computer science classrooms across the K-12 spectrum. One justification for the use of block-based environments in formal educational settings is the idea that the concepts and practices developed using these introductory tools will prepare learners for future computer science learning opportunities. This view is built on the assumption that the attitudinal and conceptual learning gains made while working in the introductory block-based environments will transfer to conventional text-based programming languages. To test this hypothesis, this paper presents the results of a quasi-experimental classroom study in which programming novices spent five-week using either a block-based or text-based programming environment. After five weeks in the introductory tool, students transitioned to Java, a conventional text-based programming language. The study followed students for 10 weeks after the transition. Over the course of the 15-week study, attitudinal and conceptual assessments were administered and student-authored programs were collected. Conceptual learning, attitudinal shifts, and changes in programming practices were analyzed to evaluate how introductory modality impacted learners as they transitioned to a professional, text-based programming language. The findings from this study build on earlier work that found a difference in performance on content assessments after the introductory portion of the study (Weintrop & Wilensky, 2017a). This paper shows the difference in conceptual learning that emerged after five weeks between the block-based and text-based conditions fades after 10 weeks in Java. No differences in programming practices were found between the two conditions while working in Java. Likewise, differences in attitudinal measures that emerged after working in the introductory environments also faded after 10 weeks in Java, resulting in no difference between the conditions after 15 weeks. The contribution of this work is to advance our understanding of the benefits and limits of block-based programming tools in preparing students for future computer science learning. This paper presents the first quasi-experimental study of the transfer of knowledge between block-based and text-based environments in a high school setting. The lack of significant differences between the two introductory programming modalities after learners transition to professional programming languages is discussed along with the implications of these findings for computer science education researchers and educators, as well as for the broader community of researchers studying the role of technology in education.",,David Weintrop and Uri Wilensky,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103646,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"Evaluation of CAL systems, Interactive learning environments, Programming and programming languages, Secondary education, Teaching/learning strategies",,103646,,Transitioning from introductory block-based and text-based environments to professional programming languages in high school computer science classrooms,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013151930199X,142.0,2019,,

One medium that has affordances to assess and support creativity in young people is video games. In this paper, we briefly discuss the literature on video games and creativity and provide an example of current work being done relative to measuring creativity in the context of a game called Physics Playground using stealth assessment. To validate the stealth assessment of creativity, we conducted a one-group pretest-posttest study with 167 8th and 9th graders from a K-12 school in Florida. Results suggest that our stealth assessment of creativity is valid (i.e., our stealth assessment estimate significantly correlated with our external performance-based measures of creativity). Additional analyses revealed that creativity (i.e., estimated using our stealth assessment of creativity) significantly predicts in-game performance (e.g., number of levels solved), game enjoyment, and learning of physics content.

The contrast experimental study about different iteratively updating strategies was acted in BFCEA, including strategy of integrating with ABC, regeneration of the worst frog and its leaping step. The key techniques focus on the first 10 and the last 10 frogs evolving ABC in BFCEA, namely, the synchronous renewal strategy for those winner and loser should be applied, after certain G times’ MSFLACM-running, so as to avoid trapping local optimum in later stage. The ABC evolution process will be called between all memes’ completing inner iteration and all frogs’ outer shuffling, the crossover operation is removed from MSFLACM for its little effect on time-consuming and convergence in this novel algorithm. Besides, in ABC, the scout bee is generated by Cauchy mutating instead at random. The performance of proposed approach is examined by well-known 16 numerical benchmark functions, and obtained results are compared with basic Shuffled Frog Leaping algorithm (abbreviation for SFLA), ABC and four other variants. The experimental results and related application in cloud resource scheduling show that the proposed algorithm is effective and outperforms other variants, in terms of solution quality and convergence, and the improved variants can obtain a lower degree of unbalanced load and relatively stable scheduling strategy of resources in complicated cloud computing environment.",,Hong-bo Wang and Xue-Na Ren and Xu-yan Tu,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2017.02.030,,,,1568-4946,Applied Soft Computing,"Artificial Bee Colony, Shuffled Frog Leaping, Evolutionary computing, Resources scheduling",,182-198,,Bee and Frog Co-Evolution Algorithm and its application,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494617301096,56.0,2017,,
article,ANTLE2022100374,"In the 21st century the academic field of Child–Computer Interaction (CCI) arose alongside burgeoning interactive technology and digital media industries that targeted children. We believe that the field of CCIU is at an important point in its development, analogous to when a child becomes a teen. Over the last few years we have each had many informal conversations with other CCI researchers in which we discuss issues such as, what is our responsibility as researchers beyond academe? What values underlie our conceptions of a ”good” childhood and the role of interactive technology in it? And, how do we ensure that our field continues to grow and evolve in ways that are consistent with our responsibilities and values? To address these and other complex questions that have been drawing our attention we came together to reflect, discuss and create a position paper for our community, in which we outline some of the issues we see facing our community at this time. To inform our deliberations with opinions beyond our own we conducted an informal consultation with 25 members of the CCI community. Our responders spanned junior to senior researchers, represented diverse geographies and included industry practitioners. These diverse responses provided further content for our reflections, and helped us see perspectives beyond our own. The result of this informal process is this speculative paper in which we propose a series of seven provocations that aim to disrupt some of the normative assumptions held in our field. Our goal in doing this is to open up dialogue in our community about these issues and promote consideration of the alternative visions we present for where we might focus our attention and efforts. We see our contribution not as truth or a definitive statement of a vision for the field, but rather as our opinion about some of the complex issues we face and that we think should be considered through dialogue as we move into the next phase of our development as an academic and scholarly community. We believe that it is urgent and critical for our field that we take up these questions, explore diverse perspectives, and critically work towards decisions and actions that will define our identity and the value of our contributions as we move forward into the next 20 years of research in CCI.",,Alissa N.

This paper presents research on the development and pilot testing of WISEngineering, a new web-based engineering design learning environment. Three middle school units were developed using a knowledge integration learning perspective and a scaffolded, informed engineering approach with the goal of improving understanding of standards-based mathematical concepts and engineering ideas. Seventh grade math students from two teachers in a socioeconomically diverse and low-performing district participated in three WISEngineering units over the course of a semester. Students significantly improved their mathematical scores from pretest to posttest for all three projects and on state standardized tests. Student, teacher, and administrator interviews reveal that WISEngineering projects promoted collaboration, tolerance, and development of pro-social skills among at-risk youth.

Embedded in that claim are a set of assumptions and tensions around the nature of scale, impact on student learning, and the scope of infrastructure encompassed by ‘learning analytics’ as a socio-technical field. Drawing on our design experience of developing learning analytics and inducting others into its use, we present a model that we have used to address five key challenges we have encountered. In developing this model, we recommend: A focus on impact on learning through augmentation of existing practice; the centrality of tasks in implementing learning analytics for impact on learning; the commensurate centrality of learning in evaluating learning analytics; inclusion of co-design approaches in implementing learning analytics across sites; and an attention to both social and technical infrastructure.",,Simon Knight and Andrew Gibson and Antonette Shibani,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iheduc.2020.100729,,,,1096-7516,The Internet and Higher Education,"Learning analytics, Implementation, Educational technology, Learning design",,100729,,Implementing learning analytics for learning impact: Taking tools to task,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751620300051,45.0,2020,,
article,ZHANG2023108553,"Summary
The rationality of block scale and structure is the guarantee of vitality and humanization quality, facing complex and diverse problems, and the structure reconstruction of urban built-up areas is one of the most difficult challenges in the process of promoting the block system. The traditional planning-construction strategy, as practice in recent years has demonstrated, faces challenges in terms of construction costs, demolition costs, property rights, and jurisprudence. Based on the interaction of the block structure and external space, the study presents a “implant-reconstruction” model. It investigates possibilities of implanting elements and graphically depicts the potential impact of implant-reconstruction using Space Syntax. The findings indicate that the external space implantation mode may actively encourage the construction of small-scale blocks and has benefits in terms of texture respect, low impact, and ease of operation. The simulation and pre-judgment dynamically illustrate the viable path and gives a scientific reference for block alteration.",,Fang Zhang and Xi Zhou,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2023.108553,,,,2589-0042,iScience,"Geographical information science, Urban planning",12.0,108553,,"Structural renovation of blocks in build-up area of Jiangnan cities, taking Suzhou new district as an example",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004223026305,26.0,2023,,
article,FIGL201596,"The main aim of this study is to investigate human understanding of process models and to develop an improved understanding of its relevant influence factors. Aided by assumptions from cognitive psychology, this article attempts to address specific deductive reasoning difficulties based on process models. The authors developed a research model to capture the influence of two effects on the cognitive difficulty of reasoning tasks: (i) the presence of different control-flow patterns (such as conditional or parallel execution) in a process model and (ii) the interactivity of model elements. Based on solutions to 61 different reasoning tasks by 155 modelers, the results from this study indicate that the presence of certain control-flow patterns influences the cognitive difficulty of reasoning tasks. In particular, sequence is relatively easy, while loops in a model proved difficult. Modelers with higher process modeling knowledge performed better and rated subjective difficulty of loops lower than modelers with lower process modeling knowledge. The findings additionally support the prediction that interactivity between model elements is positively related to the cognitive difficulty of reasoning. Our research contributes to both academic literature on the comprehension of process models and practitioner literature focusing on cognitive difficulties when using process models.",,Kathrin Figl and Ralf Laue,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2015.05.007,,,,1071-5819,International Journal of Human-Computer Studies,"Deductive reasoning, Business process models, Model comprehension, Cognitive complexity",,96-110,,Influence factors for local comprehensibility of process models,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581915001019,82.0,2015,,

article,KHRENNIKOV2006225,"We present a contextualist statistical realistic model for quantum-like representations in physics, cognitive science, and psychology. We apply this model to describe cognitive experiments to check quantum-like structures of mental processes. The crucial role is played by interference of probabilities for mental observables. Recently one such experiment based on recognition of images was performed. This experiment confirmed our prediction on the quantum-like behavior of mind. In our approach “quantumness of mind” has no direct relation to the fact that the brain (as any physical body) is composed of quantum particles. We invented a new terminology “quantum-like (QL) mind.” Cognitive QL-behavior is characterized by a nonzero coefficient of interference λ. This coefficient can be found on the basis of statistical data. There are predicted not only cos⁡θ-interference of probabilities, but also hyperbolic cosh⁡θ-interference. This interference was never observed for physical systems, but we could not exclude this possibility for cognitive systems. We propose a model of brain functioning as a QL-computer (there is a discussion on the difference between quantum and QL computers).",,Andrei Khrennikov,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2005.11.005,,,,0303-2647,Biosystems,,3.0,225-241,,Quantum-like brain: “Interference of minds”,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264705001942,84.0,2006,,
article,GURBAN2016186,"An improved system of Russian vocational education is seen as a major factor in the country’s economic development. It is currently recognized that the global labour market is emerging as a consequence of globalization processes, which significantly affect the establishment of national educational systems. The paper discusses global educational trends, with a particular focus on the tendencies in the demand for labour both in Russia and in the world. The paper aims to describe changes in attitudes towards the relevance of specialist qualifications and the sufficiency of professional competencies acquired through education. In addition, the analysis of structural changes in the Russian system of vocational education starting from 1990 to the present day is given. The research is carried out using the methods of comparative and statistical analysis. The competency maps of future are drawn (Institute for the Future, Palo Alto, the USA), including the description of trends that alter the habitual context for the labour force, as well as key skills needed for a successful career. The ‘Atlas of New Professions’ describing most promising professions in the field of education is reviewed. It is shown that the country’s role in the international division of labour can be used as an objective criterion to assess the performance of the country’s educational system. In this respect, the data on Russia’s position in the world rankings of competitiveness, innovation development and human development index, as well as the comparative data on the rate that Russian companies demonstrate in terms of innovative activity and technology exports are provided. The analysis of disproportions in the structure of graduates both in terms of levels and specialities of vocational education for the period 1990–2013 is given.

article,DUTTAMOSCATO201412,"This editorial provides insights into how informatics can attract highly trained students by involving them in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) training at the high school level and continuing to provide mentorship and research opportunities through the formative years of their education. Our central premise is that the trajectory necessary to be expert in the emergent fields in front of them requires acceleration at an early time point. Both pathology (and biomedical) informatics are new disciplines which would benefit from involvement by students at an early stage of their education. In 2009, Michael T Lotze MD, Kirsten Livesey (then a medical student, now a medical resident at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)), Richard Hersheberger, PhD (Currently, Dean at Roswell Park), and Megan Seippel, MS (the administrator) launched the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Summer Academy to bring high school students for an 8 week summer academy focused on Cancer Biology. Initially, pathology and biomedical informatics were involved only in the classroom component of the UPCI Summer Academy. In 2011, due to popular interest, an informatics track called Computer Science, Biology and Biomedical Informatics (CoSBBI) was launched. CoSBBI currently acts as a feeder program for the undergraduate degree program in bioinformatics at the University of Pittsburgh, which is a joint degree offered by the Departments of Biology and Computer Science. We believe training in bioinformatics is the best foundation for students interested in future careers in pathology informatics or biomedical informatics. We describe our approach to the recruitment, training and research mentoring of high school students to create a pipeline of exceptionally well-trained applicants for both the disciplines of pathology informatics and biomedical informatics. We emphasize here how mentoring of high school students in pathology informatics and biomedical informatics will be critical to assuring their success as leaders in the era of big data and personalized medicine.",,Joyeeta Dutta-Moscato and Vanathi Gopalakrishnan and Michael T.

article,SERHOLT2018250,"In recent years, there has been a growing research interest towards exploring the benefit of Child–Robot Interaction for educational purposes through the use of social robotics. Despite the label, such robots are typically only social within scripted activities. The current study takes a critical look at the case of a robotic tutor which was implemented in an elementary school for 3.5 months, where children repeatedly took turns interacting with the robot individually as well as in pairs. The aim of the study was to explore what caused breakdowns in children's interactions with the robotic tutor. In this qualitative study, over 14 h of video recordings of children's interaction sessions were analyzed in-depth through interaction analysis and thematic analysis. The results comprise four themes to explain why children's interactions with the robotic tutor break down: (1) the robot's inability to evoke initial engagement and identify misunderstandings, (2) confusing scaffolding, (3) lack of consistency and fairness, and finally, (4) controller problems. The implications of these breakdowns for the educational use of robots are discussed, and it is concluded that several challenges need to be rigorously addressed in order for robotic tutors to be able to feature in education.",,Sofia Serholt,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2017.12.030,,,,0747-5632,Computers in Human Behavior,"Child–robot interaction, Education, Robotic tutor, Breakdowns, Interaction analysis, Thematic analysis",,250-264,,Breakdowns in children's interactions with a robotic tutor: A longitudinal study,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563217307100,81.0,2018,,
article,BARRON2010178,"Examination of the “digital divide” has increasingly gone beyond the study of differences in physical access to computers to focus on individuals’ use of technological tools for empowered and generative uses. In this research study, we investigated the relationship between access to tools and experience with creative production activities. Our participants included 160 8th grade learners from two public middle schools. The local communities represented by the two schools differed in parent education levels, proportion of recent immigrants, and average family income. Findings indicated substantial variability in students’ history of creative production experiences within both communities. Three sets of analyses were completed. First, the two school populations were compared with respect to average levels of student creative production experience, access to tools at home, use of learning resources, frequency of technology use, and access to computing outside of their home. Second, correlates of variability in individuals’ breadth of experience with creative production activities were explored across both schools through a regression analysis. The resulting model indicated that students’ experience was best predicted by the number of technology tools available at home, number of learning resources used, frequency of computer use at home, and non-home access network size. In a third analysis, profiles of experience were created based on both breadth and depth of experience; the resulting four groups of students were compared. More experienced students utilized a broader range of learning resources, had access to more tools at home, taught a wider range of people, and were more confident in their computing skills.

We characterize the nature of this gap, highlighting design themes promoted by research-based systems that are not as prevalent in commercial systems, such as tangibility and narrative scaffolds, and vice-versa.

article,MEYER202013,"Designers are entrusted with increasingly complex and impactful challenges. However, the current system of design education does not always prepare students for these challenges. When we examine what and how our system teaches young designers, we discover that the most valuable elements of the designer’s perspective and process are seldom taught. Instead, some designers grow beyond their education through their experience working in industry, essentially learning by accident. Many design programs still maintain an insular perspective and an inefficient mechanism of tacit knowledge transfer. Meanwhile, skills for developing creative solutions to complex problems are increasingly essential. Organizations are starting to recognize that designers bring something special to this type of work, a rational belief based upon numerous studies that link commercial success to a design-driven approach. So, what are we to do? Other learned professions such as medicine, law, and business provide excellent advice and guidance embedded within their own histories of professionalization. In this article, we borrow from their experiences to recommend a course of action for design. It will not be easy: it will require a study group to make recommendations for a roster of design and educational practices that schools can use to build a curriculum that matches their goals and abilities.

article,NASIR2022100093,"The learning process depends on the nature of the learning environment, particularly in the case of open-ended learning environments, where the learning process is considered to be non-linear. In this paper, we report on the findings of employing a multimodal Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based methodology to investigate the temporal learning processes of two types of learners that have learning gains and a type that does not have learning gains in an open-ended collaborative learning activity. Considering log data, speech behavior, affective states and gaze patterns, we find that all learners start from a similar state of non-productivity, but once out of it they are unlikely to fall back into that state, especially in the case of the learners that have learning gains. Those who have learning gains shift between two problem solving strategies, each characterized by both exploratory and reflective actions, as well as demonstrate speech and gaze patterns associated with these strategies, that differ from those who don't have learning gains. Further, the teams that have learning gains also differ between themselves in the manner in which they employ the problem solving strategies over the interaction, as well as in the manner they express negative emotions while exhibiting a particular strategy.

article,TAN2020101793,"Over the years, various technical means have been developed to protect Internet users from phishing attacks. To enrich the anti-phishing efforts, we capitalise on concepts from graph theories, and propose a set of novel graph features to improve the phishing detection accuracy. The initial phase of the proposed technique involved the extraction of hyperlinks in the webpage under scrutiny and fetching the corresponding neighbourhood webpages. During this process, the page linking data were collected, and used to construct a web graph which models the overall hyperlink and network structure of the webpage. From the web graph, graph measures were computed and extracted as graph features to derive a classifier for detecting phishing webpages. Experimental results show that the proposed graph features achieve an improved overall accuracy of 97.8% when C4.5 was utilised as classifier, outperforming the existing conventional features derived from the same data samples. Unlike conventional features, the proposed graph features leverage inherent phishing patterns that are only visible at a higher level of abstraction, thus making it robust and difficult to be evaded by direct manipulations on the webpage contents. Our proposed graph-based technique also shows promising results when benchmarked against a prominent phishing detection technique.

article,ROMEROORGANVIDEZ2024112029,"Data visualization aims to convey quantitative and qualitative information effectively by determining which techniques and visualizations are most appropriate for different situations and why. Various software solutions can produce numerous visualizations of the same data set. However, data visualization encompasses a wide range of visual configurations that depend on factors such as the type of data being displayed, the different displays (e.g., scatter plots, line graphs, and pie charts), the visual components used to represent the data (e.g., lines, dots, and bars), and the specific visual attributes of those components (e.g., color, shape, size, and length). A similar problem arises when designing data tables, where the dimensionality of the data and its complexity influence the choice of the most appropriate structure (e.g., unidirectional, bidirectional). Often, this broad spectrum of configurations requires a visualization expert who knows which techniques are best for which type of data source and what is to be conveyed. Typically, researchers and developers lack knowledge of data visualization best practices and must learn the design principles that enable effective communication and the technical details of the specific software tool they use to generate visualizations. This paper proposes a software product line approach to model and realize the variability of the visualization design process, using feature models to encode knowledge about design best practices in graphs and charts. Our approach involves solving visualization design variability through a stepwise configuration process and evaluating the proposal for a specific software visualization tool. Our solution facilitates effective communication of quantitative results by helping researchers and developers select and generate the most effective visualizations for each case. This approach opens up new opportunities for research at the intersection of data visualization and variability.",,David Romero-Organvidez and Jose-Miguel Horcas and José A.

article,PARHI2022108062,"Industry 4.0 is a technology-driven digital transformation to enable data-driven decision-making based on real-time data to enhance the competitiveness of traditional manufacturing. Moving forward, adopting Industry 4.0 is an evident requirement for manufacturers to remain competitive. Currently, in the early stages of adoption in most industries and countries, there is an evident lack of foundational Industry 4.0 knowledge among decision-makers. There are few studies on the adoption of Industry 4.0; however, they focus on specific domains like cloud computing, virtual reality, IoT, etc., and are primarily set in developed countries. This research proposes a multi-stage hybrid analytic approach whereby the research model was tested using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The SEM results were used as inputs for the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to determine significant predictors for the adoption of Industry 4.0 in Indian manufacturing industries. A comprehensive sample of 350 responses from various Indian manufacturers was collected and analyzed. Results revealed that the factors viz. Software Infrastructure (SI), System Flexibility (SF), Operational Accuracy (OA), and the Technical Capabilities (TC) play a dominant role in the successful adoption intentions of Industry 4.0 in India. Manufacturers from India and other emerging economies will benefit from the findings of this study by concentrating and improving on the dominant adoption factors of Industry 4.0.

article,MOHDAMINUDDIN2023103582,"Tor is one of the most popular anonymity networks that allows Internet users to hide their browsing activity. Hiding browsing activity is essential for Internet users to increase their privacy. Only Tor users should know the website they are browsing. However, an attacker can utilise the Website Fingerprinting (WF) attack to identify webpages browsed by Tor users. WF is a significant threat to Internet users' privacy as Tor should conceal the browsed webpages' information. Existing WF studies focused on the investigation to improve the identification capabilities, overlooking the systematic discussion and assessment of existing techniques. In addition, existing surveys and analyses reviewed insufficient variation of WF on Tor techniques. Therefore, this survey paper aims to provide a systematic and thorough review of various WF on Tor techniques. First, we discuss WF on Tor techniques in five primary aspects: threat model, victim target, website realm, traffic feature, and traffic classifier. We analyse and classify the reviewed studies on each WF aspect. The classification facilitates in-depth understanding and comparison between WF on Tor techniques. Furthermore, this paper investigates nine assumptions exercised in WF on Tor: closed-world, sequential browsing, isolated traffic, replicability, traffic parsing, passive webpage, disabled cache, static content, and single webpage. These assumptions limit the WF on Tor's practicality in real-world scenarios. Our analysis and classification indicate that most WF on Tor studies apply these assumptions despite being only suitable in controlled environments or laboratory experiments. In addition, most reviewed studies often lack transparency on the assumptions exercised in their studies, risking misunderstanding the WF on Tor techniques' actual practicality. At the end of this survey, we present WF on Tor taxonomy and highlight 21 WF on Tor research's limitations and gaps with plausible recommendations. We also discuss the WF on Tor studies' contribution category and development phase.",,Mohamad Amar Irsyad {Mohd Aminuddin} and Zarul Fitri Zaaba and Azman Samsudin and Faiz Zaki and Nor Badrul Anuar,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnca.2023.103582,,,,1084-8045,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,"Security, Privacy, Anonymity, Tor, Traffic analysis, Website fingerprinting",,103582,,The rise of website fingerprinting on Tor: Analysis on techniques and assumptions,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804523000012,212.0,2023,,

article,FRECHETTE2021137,"The number of Dual Language Learners (DLLs) in the United States is rapidly increasing, with over 25% of the preschoolers speaking a language other than English at home leading to a need to examine skills that contribute to their achievement. Executive Control (EC), or the ability to regulate attention, affect, and behavior effectively, is one skill that is particularly important for preschool children to develop. EC has been examined for monolingual children as a single construct, and as two related constructs, Cool Executive Control (CEC) and Hot Executive Control (HEC), and is associated with later academic outcomes. The purpose of this study was to extend the EC research to DLL preschoolers, determine if EC is a one or two factor construct in a sample of DLLs, and examine if the construct relates to DLL children’s science achievement. Structural equation modeling was used with a sample of 181 DLL children enrolled in Head Start. In line with previous research on monolingual Head Start children, EC emerged as two distinct latent factors, CEC and HEC. This study also examined the association between concurrent CEC, HEC, and science achievement. CEC was positively associated with DLLs’ science achievement, whereas HEC was not.

article,CORDASCO201815,"Computational Social Science (CSS) involves interdisciplinary fields and exploits computational methods, such as social network analysis as well as computer simulation with the goal of better understanding social phenomena. Agent-Based Models (ABMs) represent an effective research tool for CSS and consist of a class of models, which, aim to emulate or predict complex phenomena through a set of simple rules (i.e., independent actions, interactions and adaptation), performed by multiple agents. The efficiency and scalability of ABMs systems are typically obtained distributing the overall computation on several machines, which interact with each other in order to simulate a specific model. Unfortunately, the design of a distributed simulation model is particularly challenging, especially for domain experts who sporadically are computer scientists and are not used to developing parallel code. D-MASON framework is a distributed version of the MASON library for designing and executing ABMs in a distributed environment ensuring scalability and easiness. D-MASON enable the developer to exploit the computing power of distributed environment in a transparent manner; the developer has to do simple incremental modifications to existing MASON models, without re-designing them. This paper presents several novel features and architectural improvements introduced in the D-MASON framework: an improved space partitioning strategy, a distributed 3D field, a distributed network field, a decentralized communication layer, a novel memory consistency mechanism and the integration to cloud environments.

Transmitted knowledge is often not understood nor applied, as demonstrated in studies of human papillomavirus vaccination education. An alternative to knowledge transmission is the approach that aims to foster critical literacy, which is grounded in critical thinking essential to the practice of science. The chapter reviews a number of interdisciplinary science education activities that introduce health issues in the context of biology, physics, and chemistry education, ensuring deep understanding needed for developing critical literacy.

article,AOKI2013310,"Many nations are greatly affected by their education policies, and the educational level of different schools is relevant to a nation’s ICT policy. In the area of ICT, Korea has achieved quite high levels of competency. This study analyzed the level of ICT competency of 4490 elementary and 2419 middle schools in Korea within the context of the Korean educational system and social circumstances. The findings are as follows: first, differences in ICT level were greater among elementary schools than among middle schools; and secondly, ICT usage had a great impact on the ICT composite index for both elementary and middle schools. For both elementary and middle schools, the indicators that were found to have the greatest impact on the ICT composite index were ‘effort to make use of computers and ICT resources’ and ‘teaching of ICT-related subjects.’ Another variable that affected ICT competency was the level of ICT competency among the teachers and their willingness to use ICT in their lessons. This study found that merely the building of an ICT infrastructure is not enough to enhance the ICT level of schools.

article,ADORNI2024100466,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital competencies, the need for a robust and universal method to assess students’ algorithmic thinking (AT) skills has become increasingly pronounced. Algorithmic thinking refers to the ability to analyse a problem and develop a step-by-step process to solve it. This research investigates the efficacy of the Cross Array Task (CAT) as an assessment tool for AT skills within Switzerland’s compulsory education system. Originally conceptualised as an unplugged activity, where students performed the task without digital technologies (e.g., by using gestures on paper) and an administrator manually assessed them, the CAT evolved into a digital activity that runs on an iPad. The CAT’s digital transformation has automated the scoring of student responses and data collection, streamlining the assessment processes and facilitating efficient large-scale assessments. It has also enhanced scalability, making the CAT suitable for widespread use in educational settings. Furthermore, it provides immediate feedback to students and educators, supporting timely interventions and personalised learning experiences. Our study aims to comprehensively investigate algorithmic competencies in compulsory education, examining their variations and influencing factors. This research examines key variables, such as age, sex, educational environment and school characteristics (e.g., the level and grade of education), and regional factors (e.g., the canton of the school) in Switzerland, and characteristics related to the specific assessment tool, including the type of artefact used, the complexity of the algorithms generated, and the level of autonomy. Additionally, it seeks to analyse the effectiveness of the unplugged and digital approaches in assessing AT skills, specifically comparing the unplugged and virtual CAT versions, aiming to provide insights into their advantages and potential synergies. This investigation delineates the developmental progression of AT skills across compulsory education, emphasising the influence of age on algorithm development and problem-solving strategies. Furthermore, we reveal the impact of artefacts and the potential of digital tools to facilitate advanced AT skill development across diverse age groups. Finally, our investigation delves into the influence of school environments and sex disparities on AT performance, alongside the significant individual variability influenced by personal abilities and external circumstances. These findings underscore the importance of tailored educational interventions and equitable practices to accommodate diverse learning profiles and optimise student outcomes in AT across educational settings.",,Giorgia Adorni and Igor Artico and Alberto Piatti and Elia Lutz and Luca Maria Gambardella and Lucio Negrini and Francesco Mondada and Dorit Assaf,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chbr.2024.100466,,,,2451-9588,Computers in Human Behavior Reports,"Teaching/learning strategies, 21st century abilities, Evaluation methodologies, Elementary education, Secondary education",,100466,,Development of algorithmic thinking skills in K-12 education: A comparative study of unplugged and digital assessment instruments,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S245195882400099X,15.0,2024,,

article,WU201535,"Effects of multiple external representations on teaching and learning have been widely researched; however, relatively little is understood about how different types of representations used for item presentation influence students' performances in computer-based assessments, particularly in those evaluating complex abilities. We designed a multimedia-based assessment for secondary school students that focused on scientific inquiry abilities (i.e., questioning, experimenting, analyzing, and explaining). Through the participation of 1218 students (561 8th graders and 657 11th graders), the balanced arrangement of test booklets, and the use of a generalized partial credit Rasch model, this study aimed at investigating how the modality of representations for item presentation (i.e., dynamic and static) and type of visual information (i.e., context and content) conveyed by the representations affected the item difficulty of the multimedia-based assessment. The results showed that overall items became slightly more difficult for students when the item presentation was static. Also, the interaction effect between modality and grade was significant; when item presentation was changed from dynamic to static, the items became easier to the 8th graders, whereas they were more difficult to the 11th graders. The results suggested that older students might have more cognitive resources to retrieve information from dynamic displays to solve the assessment tasks successfully. Additionally, while all interactions between modality and type of information on items with context visuals were not significant, there were significant interactions on four items with content visuals. A further examination of the items suggested that the tasks and the phenomena involved in the items may influence how modality affected the item difficulties when content visuals were used. These results implied that researchers need to pay special attention on the design of content visuals because they appear to be more influential than context ones to students' performances of science assessments.",,Hsin-Kai Wu and Che-Yu Kuo and Tsung-Hau Jen and Ying-Shao Hsu,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2015.01.007,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"Architectures for educational technology system, Secondary education, Applications in subject areas",,35-48,,What makes an item more difficult?

article,MARKAUSKAITE2022100056,"The proliferation of AI in many aspects of human life—from personal leisure, to collaborative professional work, to global policy decisions—poses a sharp question about how to prepare people for an interconnected, fast-changing world which is increasingly becoming saturated with technological devices and agentic machines. What kinds of capabilities do people need in a world infused with AI? How can we conceptualise these capabilities? How can we help learners develop them? How can we empirically study and assess their development? With this paper, we open the discussion by adopting a dialogical knowledge-making approach. Our team of 11 co-authors participated in an orchestrated written discussion. Engaging in a semi-independent and semi-joint written polylogue, we assembled a pool of ideas of what these capabilities are and how learners could be helped to develop them. Simultaneously, we discussed conceptual and methodological ideas that would enable us to test and refine our hypothetical views. In synthesising these ideas, we propose that there is a need to move beyond AI-centred views of capabilities and consider the ecology of technology, cognition, social interaction, and values.",,Lina Markauskaite and Rebecca Marrone and Oleksandra Poquet and Simon Knight and Roberto Martinez-Maldonado and Sarah Howard and Jo Tondeur and Maarten {De Laat} and Simon {Buckingham Shum} and Dragan Gašević and George Siemens,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100056,,,,2666-920X,Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence,"Capabilities for AI, AI in education, Postdigital dialogue, Ecological approach",,100056,,Rethinking the entwinement between artificial intelligence and human learning: What capabilities do learners need for a world with AI?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X2200011X,3.0,2022,,

The two problems that characterize the modern psychology of thinking are mental representation and mental computation. Throughout the history of psychology, there has been an agreement that the essential features of a problem are that an organism has a goal but lacks a clear or well-learned route to the goal. Thus the emphasis in research on problem solving has been on response discovery—how the organism arrives at an effective, goal-attaining behavior. There have often been controversies over the role of learning or past experiences in problem solving. This chapter illustrates the conflict between emphases on learning and emphases on perception as central components of problem solving. Because a problem solver must find a solution, it might seem inevitable that an essential activity tries different approaches makes errors until the right approach is found. Earlier in problem-solving research, trial and error became associated with the view that acquiring a solution was a gradual, undirected process that did not involve perception or comprehension of problem requirements or structure.",San Diego,Roger L.

This chapter discusses the causes of memory interference and the extent of situations in which these mechanisms operate. First, the chapter discusses some widely held assumptions about the situation of interference, focusing on the idea that such effects arise from competition for access via a shared retrieval cue. This notion is sufficiently general that it may be applied in a variety of interference settings, which is illustrated briefly. Then the classical interference paradigms from which these ideas emerged are reviewed. The chapter also reviews more recent phenomena that both support and challenge classical conceptions of interference. These phenomena provide compelling illustrations of the generality of interference and, consequently, of the importance of understanding its mechanisms. A recent perspective on interference is highlighted that builds upon insights from modern work, while validating intuitions underlying several of the classical interference mechanisms. According to this new perspective, forgetting derives not from acquiring new memories per se, but from the impact of later retrievals of the newly learned material. After discussing findings from several paradigms that support this retrieval-based view, the chapter illustrates how forgetting might be linked to inhibitory processes underlying selective attention.",San Diego,Michael C.

article,GRAY2019124,"For children to yield greater mental performance abilities in real world settings, training approaches should offer practice in problems which have an affective component requiring social interactions, and be motivating over a sustained period. Current cognitive training games often overlook the important relationship between cognition and emotion, characterised by ‘hot executive function’, and correlated with fundamental academic and life outcomes. Here, we present robust qualitative evidence from a case study which documents the social relationships, motivation and engagement of a class of ten-year-old children who used an active smartphone cognitive training game called BrainQuest in their physical education lessons over a period of 5 weeks. Game design elements which are intended to move beyond simple gamification of cognitive tests are presented, along with a discussion of how these design elements worked in practice. The paper also presents and discusses the impact of the game upon the cognitive and emotional regulatory skills, characterised by executive function skills, based on the findings of this initial work.

This chapter is an attempt to clear the names of artificial intelligence (AI) and computational cognitive science. These two related disciplines have been accused of a conceptual error so profound that their very existence is jeopardized. Sometimes, however, philosophers successfully arrest and lock up the guilty. The best example of this, ironically, is in psychology. Artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science are both committed to the claim that computers can think. The former is committed to the claim that human-made computers can think, while computational cognitive science is committed to the view that naturally occurring computers, brains, think. AI is the field dedicated to building intelligent computers. AI ultimately wants a machine that could solve very difficult, novel problems like proving Fermat's last theorem, correcting the greenhouse effect, or figuring out the fundamental structure of space-time. Historically, AI is associated with computer science, but the compleat AI researcher frequently knows a fair amount of psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, mathematics, and possibly some other discipline.",,Eric Dietrich,Thinking Computers and Virtual Persons,https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-215495-9.50006-5,,Eric Dietrich,978-0-12-215495-9,,,,,3-34,Academic Press,CHAPTER 1 - Thinking Computers and The Problem of Intentionality,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780122154959500065,,1994,,
incollection,PAYDAR2023165,"Radiation hardening, also known as “rad hardening,” and radiation survivability testing are of critical importance to defense, aerospace, and energy industries. Everyone knows that excessive exposure to radiation can cause severe damage to living things, but high radiation levels can also cause radiation damage to other objects, especially electronics. Ionizing radiation in particular, including directly ionizing radiation such as alpha and beta particles and indirectly ionizing radiation such as gamma rays and neutron radiation, is profoundly damaging to the semiconductors that make up the backbone of all modern electronics. Just one charged particle can interfere with thousands of electrons, causing signal noise, disrupting digital circuits, and even causing permanent physical radiation damage. Radiation hardening involves designing radiation-tolerant electronics and components that are tolerant of the massive levels of ionizing radiation, such as cosmic outer space radiation, X-ray radiation in medical or security environments, and high energy radiation within nuclear power plants. In order to test these components and determine whether they are sufficiently hardened, radiation-hardened electronics manufacturers perform rigorous testing as part of their product manufacturing processes. Components which pass these tests go into production and can be described as “radiation-hardened”; components that do not go back to design.",,Ali Zamani Paydar and Seyed Kamal Mousavi Balgehshiri and Bahman Zohuri,Advanced Reactor Concepts (ARC),https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-443-18989-0.00003-X,,Ali Zamani Paydar and Seyed Kamal Mousavi Balgehshiri and Bahman Zohuri,978-0-443-18989-0,,,"Nuclear power plants, Design basis accident, Loss of coolant accident, Shielding, Neutron reflector, Nuclear submarines, Halving thickness values, Artificial intelligence",,165-233,Elsevier,Chapter 3 - Nuclear power reactions driven radiation hardening environments,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978044318989000003X,,2023,,
article,KUGEL1986137,"The uncomputable parts of thinking (if there are any) can be studied in much the same spirit that Turing (1950) suggested for the study of its computable parts. We can develop precise accounts of cognitive processes that, although they involve more than computing, can still be modelled on the machines we call ‘computers’. In this paper, I want to suggest some ways that this might be done, using ideas from the mathematical theory of uncomputability (or Recursion Theory). And I want to suggest some uses to which the resulting models might be put.

This chapter introduces the research that done at the University of South Florida to determine the biocompatibility of single-crystal SiC and related materials with neuronal and glial cells to determine whether they are possible candidate materials for the construction of a neuronal implantation device. It describes the basics about the CNS, how it is organized, and its major cellular constituents are described and their purposes within the CNS. Following this, it considers the research investigating the in vitro biocompatibility of 3C-SiC and a related material, nanocrystalline diamond (NCD), with immortalized neuronal and CNS cell lines. The in vitro reaction of primary derived neurons with 3C-SiC is also detailed, followed by initial in vivo testing of 3C-SiC within the brain of a wild-type mouse. The central nervous system (CNS) is composed of the brain and spinal cord. Blood is not in direct contact with the extracellular fluid within the CNS because of restrictive endothelial cells that create a tight junction known as the blood–brain barrier. Any physical biomedical device that would interact with the CNS has to deal with cells that perform functions similar to their leukocyte counterparts found within the bloodstream. The therapeutic utility provided by these devices is that they could be utilized as a platform for drug delivery behind the blood–brain barrier to specific CNS areas, or to transport neuronal factors or even other cells to the CNS to assist in the repair of the neural system damaged by trauma and disease.",Oxford,Christopher L.
