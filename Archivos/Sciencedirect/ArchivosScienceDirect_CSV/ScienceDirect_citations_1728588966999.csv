article,LIU2017300,"To tackle the problem of efficiently managing increasingly complex systems, simulation models have been widely used. This is because simulation is safer, less expensive, and faster than field implementation and experimenting. To achieve high fidelity and credibility in conducting prediction and exploration of the actual system with simulation models, a rigorous calibration and validation procedure should firstly be applied. However, one of the key issues in calibration is the acquisition of valid source information from the target system. The aim of this study is to develop a systematic method to automatically calibrate a general emergency department model with incomplete data. The simulation-based optimization was used to search for the best value of model parameters. Then we present a case study to particularly demonstrate the way to calibrate an agent-based model of an emergency department with real data scarcity. The case study indicates that the proposed method appears to be capable of properly calibrating and validating the simulation model with incomplete data.",,Zhengchun Liu and Dolores Rexachs and Francisco Epelde and Emilio Luque,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2016.11.036,,,,0360-8352,Computers & Industrial Engineering,"Simulation-based optimization, Model calibration, Agent-based model, Emergency department",,,300-309,,A simulation and optimization based method for calibrating agent-based emergency department models under data scarcity,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360835216304685,103,2017

article,WESTERBERG2022105473,"A limited body of work has examined the nature and scope of young children’s science-related activities outside of the school context, and thus there is little understanding or consensus regarding what comprises the home science environment (HSE; e.g., interactions, activities, resources) and how specific factors of the HSE relate to children’s science performance. The two primary goals of this study were to (a) examine the factor structure of a parent-report measure of home science interactions and (b) evaluate how these factors relate to the science core knowledge of young children from families with low incomes. A total of 125 families with children aged 3 to 5 years (52 girls) participated in the study. Children were assessed on a measure of science core knowledge, and parents completed a brief questionnaire on their home science interactions that included questions pertaining to both home science disciplinary core idea (DCI) engagement and home science and engineering practice (SEP) engagement. Findings revealed that although separating home science interactions into distinct DCI and SEP factors represented the data well, the best overall representation of home science interactions was a one-factor model that included only home DCI engagement items. In addition, home DCI engagement was significantly predictive of children’s science core knowledge over and above a large group of covariates, including children’s age, race/ethnicity, sex, and performance on math, executive function, and vocabulary tasks as well as their parents’ education.",,Lauren Westerberg and Sara A.

article,COURTNEYMUSTAPHI201977,"Radiometric dating methods are essential for developing geochronologies to study Late Quaternary environmental change and 210Pb dating is commonly used to produce age-depth models from recent (within 150 years) sediments and other geoarchives. The past two centuries are marked by rapid environmental socio-ecological changes frequently attributed to anthropogenic land-use activities, modified biogeochemical cycles, and climate change. Consequently, historical reconstructions over this recent time interval have high societal value because analyses of these datasets provide understanding of the consequences of environmental modifications, critical ecosystem thresholds, and to define desirable ranges of variation for management, restoration, and conservation. For this information to be used more broadly, for example to support land management decisions or to contribute data to regional analyses of ecosystem change, authors must report all of the useful age-depth model information. However, at present there are no guidelines for researchers on what information should be reported to ensure 210Pb data are fully disclosed, reproducible, and reusable; leading to a plethora of reporting styles, including inadequate reporting that reduces potential reusability and shortening the data lifecycle. For example, 64% of the publications in a literature review of 210Pb dated geoarchives did not include any presentation of age uncertainty estimates in modeled calendar ages used in age-depth models. Insufficient reporting of methods and results used in 210Pb dating geoarchives severely hampers reproducibility and data reusability, especially in analyses that make use of databased palaeoenvironmental data. Reproducibility of data is fundamental to further analyses of the number of palaeoenvironmental data and the spatial coverage of published geoarchives sites. We suggest, and justify, a set of minimum reporting guidelines for metadata and data reporting for 210Pb dates, including an IEDA (Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance), LiPD (Linked Paleo Data) and generic format data presentation templates, to contribute to improvements in data archiving standards and to facilitate the data requirements of researchers analyzing datasets of several palaeoenvironmental study sites. We analyse practices of methods, results and first order interpretation of 210Pb data and make recommendations to authors on effective data reporting and archiving to maximize the value of datasets. We provide empirical evidence from publications and practitioners to support our suggested reporting guidelines. These guidelines increase the scientific value of 210Pb by expanding its relevance in the data lifecycle. Improving quality and fidelity of environmental datasets broadens interdisciplinary use, lengthens the potential lifecycle of data products, and achieves requirements applicable for evidenced-based policy support.",,Colin J. {Courtney Mustaphi} and Janice Brahney and Marco A.

article,PETRI201768,"Educational games are assumed to be an effective and efficient instructional strategy for computing education. However, it is essential to systematically evaluate such games in order to obtain sound evidence of their impact. Thus, the objective of this article is to present the state of the art on how games for computing education are evaluated. Therefore, we performed a systematic literature review of a sample of 3617 articles from which 112 relevant articles have been identified, describing 117 studies on the evaluation of games for computing education. Based on these studies we analyzed how evaluations are defined (the analysis factors evaluated, research designs, evaluation models/methods used, kind of data collection instruments, etc.), how they have been executed (sample size and replications) and analyzed (data analysis methods used). As a result, we can confirm that most evaluations use a simple research design in which, typically, the game is used and afterwards subjective feedback is collected via questionnaires from the learners. The majority of the evaluations are run with small samples, without replication, using mostly qualitative methods for data analysis. We also observed that most studies do not use a well-defined evaluation model or method. This shows that there is a need for more rigorous evaluations as well as methodological support in order to assist game creators and instructors to improve such games as well as to systematically support decisions on when or how to include them within instructional units.",,Giani Petri and Christiane {Gresse von Wangenheim},,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2017.01.004,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"Evaluation, Educational game, Computing education, Systematic literature review, Computer science",,,68-90,,How games for computing education are evaluated?

article,DELAHERA2022105335,"There is growing interest in teaching computer science and programming skills in schools. Here we investigated the efficacy of peer tutoring, which is known to be a useful educational resource in other domains but never before has been examined in such a core aspect of applied logical thinking in children. We compared (a) how children (N = 42, age range = 7 years 1 month to 8 years 4 months) learn computer programming from an adult versus learning from a peer and (b) the effect of teaching a peer versus simply revising what has been learned. Our results indicate that children taught by a peer showed comparable overall performance—a combination of accuracy and response times—to their classmates taught by an adult. However, there was a speed–accuracy trade-off, and peer-taught children showed more exploratory behavior, with shorter response times at the expense of lower accuracy. In contrast, no tutor effects (i.e., resulting from teaching a peer) were found. Thus, our results provide empirical evidence in support of peer tutoring as a way to help teach computer programming to children.

article,WESTERBERG2021100981,"There is little empirical evidence on cross-domain relations with science and other academic domains, which contributes to a limited understanding of the development of early science and how to best support it. The purpose of this study was to examine multiple concurrent predictors of science core knowledge, including executive functioning (EF), vocabulary, literacy, math, and math language in preschool. This study overcomes the limitations of previous work exploring relations between individual predictors, by addressing potentially spurious relations due to acting as proxies for other variables. Data were collected from 86 preschool-aged children (36 female) from families with low incomes. Findings revealed that when EF, vocabulary, literacy, math, and math language were included in the same model as concurrent predictors of science, only vocabulary significantly predicted children’s science core knowledge.

article,ISMAILOVA2021332,"One of the aims of this work is to revise the known issues of how to obtain the value of the expression using an applicative computing system. Computation and/or symbolic transformations have undoubtedly become one of the dominant trends in modern computer science. In particular, this refers to the execution of the processes of inference of an object with given properties, which is studied with the formation of sets of equalities leading to a target computational model. At the same time, the mathematical theory of computation gets a target equational description, making the process of studying its properties and capabilities more suitable. A model structure based on the method of indexed expressions is developed and applied using the notions of evaluation mapping and assignments. As shown, this may not be considered as generic notion, but derived using the combinators. Thus, the semantics of computation can be derived from the construction of a combinator-as-process. This is the embedding into a system of combinators. A linking system of equalities between combinatorsl is established, which serving as a generic computational model. This allows us to look differently at the previous cognitive ideas of the semantics of computation disabling an evaluation map and assignments and enabling their replacement by a set of equalities between combinators.",,Larisa Ismailova and Viacheslav Wolfengagen and Sergey Kosikov,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2021.06.058,,,,1877-0509,Procedia Computer Science,"information process, model structure, indexed expressions, cognitive model, combinator-as-process",2020 Annual International Conference on Brain-Inspired Cognitive Architectures for Artificial Intelligence: Eleventh Annual Meeting of the BICA Society,,332-340,,Equalities between Combinators to Evaluate Expressions,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050921013053,190,2021

Nevertheless, the research on how SRL behaviors dynamically interact over time in a network architecture is still in its infancy, especially in the context of STEM (sciences, technology, engineering, and math) learning. In the present paper, we used a multilevel vector autoregression (VAR) model to examine the temporal dynamics of SRL behaviors as 101 students designed green buildings in Energy3D, a simulation-based computer-aided design (CAD) environment. We examined how different performance groups (i.e., unsuccessful, success-oriented, and mastery-oriented groups) differed in SRL competency, actual SRL behaviors, and SRL networks. We found that the three groups had no significant difference in their perceived SRL competency; however, they differed in SRL behaviors of evaluation. Both the mastery-oriented and success-oriented groups performed more evaluation behaviors than the unsuccessful group. Moreover, the mastery-oriented group showed stronger interaction between SRL behaviors than the success-oriented group and the unsuccessful group. The SRL networks of the three groups shared some similarities, but they were different from each other in general.

article,PAL2020105535,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a physical shutdown of all types of educational institutes worldwide due to which the education delivery has now shifted to an “online only” exclusivity model. In this perspective, perceived usability of the online learning platforms that are currently being used is an important aspect, especially due to the absence of any physical classes. In this work Microsoft Teams is used as the reference platform for which the perceived usability is evaluated. For the evaluation purpose a dual strategy is followed by using the System Usability Scale (SUS), which is a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) based approach, and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which is an Information Systems (IS) based approach. Although both these instruments are popular in their respective domains, yet they have not been considered simultaneously in one work for the purpose of usability evaluation. By doing so, this work attempts to streamline and unify the process of usability evaluation. Results that are obtained from a large-scale survey of university students show the similarity and equivalency between the two methodologies, with the Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) construct of TAM having greater similarity with SUS.

article,PRINSLOO2023102901,"The invention of floatovoltaic technologies brought new meaning to the theoretical framing of sustainability as the technology delivers extended natural resource conservation benefits. However, planning assessments for this novel sustainable energy technology exposed knowledge gaps jeopardising global financial investments and regulatory approvals. Knowledge and methodological gaps cause inaccurate performance predictions in current geospatial-engineering modelling tools and fail to adequately quantify the diverse range of layered performance qualities and impacts of floating photovoltaics. This paper advances a geo-sensitive system dynamics framework to systemically integrate the energy, environmental and economic domain object functions in characterising the behaviour and sustainability of floating photovoltaic systems theoretically. The framework serves as computer logic in a geospatial digital twin to synthesise floatovoltaic operations to predict the technology’s sustainability impact and offset attributes in balanced scorecard metrics and water–energy–land–food nexus indicators. Experimental evaluations with the proposed framework in a real-world setting demonstrate the value of the holistically integrated framework in analytical floatovoltaic project appraisal and planning support. The results highlight significant advantages when comparing a 1000 m2 floatovoltaic system with a similar-sized conventional photovoltaic alternative, including a 19.3% lifetime energy gain, a carbon emission displacement of CO2e=5168t and a freshwater evaporation benefit of 983 kL.

Self-efficacy is described as one of the most critical determinants of competent digital system use, and various self-report scales for assessing digital self-efficacy have been suggested. Yet, these scales largely differ in their proposed specificity, structure, validation, and timeliness.

article,JIANG2022102058,"Coding is a highly valued skill used in many disciplines across the globe. However, it is reported that students’ coding interest and self-efficacy are usually low. Theoretically, the affective domain of coding is in its infancy, and very few studies have set out to identify the determinants of coding interest and self-efficacy. This study explored how mathematics interest and self-efficacy, as two important mathematics-related factors, influenced coding interest and self-efficacy. Employing a quantitative cross-sectional survey design, 605 students from two public senior high schools in two big cities in China were investigated. A two-step structural equation modeling approach was adopted to analyze the data. Findings showed that mathematics interest, directly and indirectly, influenced coding interest significantly.

article,HELBING2023102061,"The technological revolution, particularly the availability of more data and more powerful computational tools, has led to the emergence of a new scientific field called “Computational Diplomacy”. Our work tries to define its scope and focuses on a popular subarea of it, namely “Digital Democracy”. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in using digital technologies to promote more participatory forms of democracy. While there are numerous potential benefits to using digital tools to enhance democracy, significant challenges must be addressed. It is essential to ensure that digital technologies are used in an accessible, equitable, and fair manner rather than reinforcing existing power imbalances. This paper investigates how digital tools can be used to help design more democratic societies by investigating three key research areas: (1) the role of digital technologies for facilitating civic engagement in collective decision-making; (2) the use of digital tools to improve transparency and accountability in governance; and (3) the potential for digital technologies to enable the formation of more inclusive and representative democracies.

article,LIU2024105109,"In the Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) forum, learning engagement encompasses three fundamental dimensions—cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagement—that intricately interact to jointly influence students' learning achievements. However, the interplay between multiple engagement dimensions and their correlations with learning achievement remain understudied, particularly across different academic disciplines. This study adopts an automated configurational approach that integrates bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore the configurations of learning engagement, their connections with learning achievement, and variations across disciplines. Our analysis reveals a nuanced profile of learners' learning engagement, indicating the high-achieving individuals demonstrated more frequent posting and commenting behaviors and the high-level cognitive engagement than low-achieving individuals. Second, our analysis revealed multiple configurations where the coexistence or absence of factors at different levels of the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional dimensions significantly impacted learning achievement. Learners who conducted posting and replying behaviors, expressed positive emotions, and engaged in deep cognitive engagement tended to achieve superior learning outcomes. Third, there were significant differences in behavioral and emotional engagement among learners across different academic disciplines. Specifically, pure discipline learners were more inclined to engage in posting behaviors than the applied discipline learners. Across academic disciplines, positive emotions correlated strongly with higher achievement.

article,LIANG2023104827,"Digital technology has brought new opportunities for language education. Multimodal literacy refers to the ability to read, watch, understand, respond to, and generate multimodal texts. Multimodality, promoted by scholars, generates meaning in multiple modes. Hence, digital storytelling (DST) presented with multimodal content has been extensively applied in second language instruction. However, traditional DST is mostly presented in videos with one-way communication; it lacks two-way communication with the audience and is only regarded as a learning method for knowledge acquisition. As a result, the present study proposed a robot-based DST (robot-DST) approach to facilitate the interaction in the DST process and to enhance students' engagement. In order to evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experiment was conducted in an EFL course at a senior high school. Two classes of 11th graders participated in the experiment. One class with 40 students was the experimental group adopting the robot-DST approach, while the other class with 40 students was the control group adopting the conventional animation-based DST (CA-DST) approach. The results showed that the robot-DST approach could significantly reduce students' communication apprehension, as well as enhance their English speaking ability, storytelling ability, narrative engagement, and communication tendency. The findings show that using robots in the context of digital storytelling design has great potential for promoting learners’ language learning performances.

article,SOSAREYES2022676,"In 2013, the Forensic Science Undergraduate Program (FSUP) at the National Autonomous University of Mexico was created in response to an alarming criminal situation in Mexico, as well as to the radical reform of its criminal justice system. Its mission is to educate and train ethical, critical, and humanistic forensic scientists capable of conducting inquiries that meet scientific quality standards and assist the justice system in firmly linking legal rulings to the available evidence. At the time, it was the first such program in the country, and the contributions that interdisciplinary forensic scientists could make to criminal investigations were largely unknown among forensic and legal practitioners. During its existence, providing an interdisciplinary, competence-based education to students has been one of the main challenges. To overcome it, teaching and assessment approaches—centered on the achievement of specifically forensic competencies as learning outcomes and the integration of forensic disciplines towards the resolution of simulated cases—have been devised to help develop the professional skill set expected of graduates. The COVID-19 pandemic led to adapting these approaches to distance or hybrid modes of learning, increasing their versatility and enriching the pedagogic repertoire of the FSUP. Currently, the main impact of the program lies in the successful incorporation of some of its graduates to agencies belonging to or related to the criminal justice system, such as the National Prosecutor’s Office, the Commission for Truth and Justice for the Ayotzinapa Case, and the National Commission for the Search of Missing and Disappeared Persons, among others.",,Ana María Sosa-Reyes and Alexa Villavicencio-Queijeiro and Luis Jiro Suzuri-Hernández,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scijus.2022.08.006,,,,1355-0306,Science & Justice,"Interdisciplinary, Teaching, Forensic science, Pre-pandemic, Post-pandemic","The Future of Teaching, Training and Learning in Forensic and Crime Sciences",6,676-690,,"Interdisciplinary approaches to the teaching of forensic science in the Forensic Science Undergraduate Program of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, before and after COVID-19",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135503062200106X,62,2022
article,LAI2023100178,"Background
ChatGPT, a powerful artificial intelligence chatbot, has great potential for active learning because of its ability to generate instant responses to academic inquiries and foster spontaneous interactions.
Purpose
This exploratory study investigated the roles of intrinsic motivation and factors of the technology acceptance model that influence ChatGPT acceptance for active learning among undergraduates in Hong Kong.
Method
Using a structural equation modeling approach, we examined the extended technology acceptance model in the context of higher education. Using self-report questionnaires, we obtained useful responses from 473 undergraduate students in Hong Kong in July 2023. The reliability and validity of the data were measured using confirmatory factor analysis, followed by path analysis to investigate the hypotheses in the proposed model.
Results
We identified intrinsic motivation as the strongest motivator for ChatGPT use intention. Consistent with the prior literature on technology acceptance, perceived usefulness was found to be a strong predictor of behavioral intention. In contrast to extant research, the findings indicate no significant relationship between perceived ease of use and behavioral intention. Neither perceived usefulness nor perceived ease of use were significant mediators in the relationship between intrinsic motivation and behavioral intention.
Conclusion
These findings highlight the significant effect of intrinsic motivation on ChatGPT acceptance in supporting students’ active learning. They also provide inspiration for ChatGPT developers and educationalists regarding the importance of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (perceived usefulness) in promoting the broader acceptance of chatbots in the educational context. Efforts should be made to improve students’ positive subjective experiences and the response quality of ChatGPT.",,Chung Yee Lai and Kwok Yip Cheung and Chee Seng Chan,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2023.100178,,,,2666-920X,Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence,"Technology acceptance model, ChatGPT, Intrinsic motivation, Chatbot, Active learning",,,100178,,Exploring the role of intrinsic motivation in ChatGPT adoption to support active learning: An extension of the technology acceptance model,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X23000577,5,2023

A systematic search of 11 databases identified a total of 350 unique items that contain “digital citizenship” in the title or keywords published by December 2018, with the majority published after 2010. Of these, 114 were peer-reviewed journal articles published in a wide range of discipline-specific venues, more than half of which were education-related. In-depth analyses show that each of the dominant conceptualizations of DC has been adopted by different disciplines, albeit with different popularities in adoption. Findings also revealed widely shared stakeholder concerns and research foci in DC research across the disciplines.

article,ZARESTKY2022100085,"Computational Science and Engineering (CS&E) is a relatively new discipline for which no consensus exists on how classes should best be taught. Many CS&E courses are compressed add-ons to existing programs and, consequently, must cover a breadth of topics encompassing modules from mathematics, statistics, computer science, and application disciplines. Additionally, these courses would benefit from embedded 21st century skills, including problem-solving, critical thinking, and lifelong learning behaviors, but such skills are often neglected in course design even though the education and workforce literature are clear about their importance for future careers. The breadth and complexity in course design necessary to incorporate all of these components create a challenge for instructors and students. In this interpretive study, we investigate student experiences and perceived outcomes in a technology-mediated graduate-level CS&E course designed to address the difficulties associated with this wide range of disciplinary topics and professional skills. Our course design is based on reflective practice and principles of metacognition, and applies elements such as a flipped classroom, student journals, and reflective writing exercises; these design goals directly support students’ metacognition and foster self-regulated learning behaviors that, in turn, develop critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. We evaluate this design using student reflective writing and surveys. Results indicate reflective writing activities in course design helped develop students’ metacognitive awareness, self-regulated learning behaviors, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills.

article,KINOSHITA201616,"Across the globe, wildfires are increasing in frequency and magnitude under a warming climate, impacting natural resources, infrastructure, and millions of people every year. At the same time, human encroachment into fire-prone areas has increased the potential for ignition, as well as risks and damages to human communities. In an era of intensifying human activities on Earth – the “Anthropocene” – societal interactions with post-fire landscapes are becoming commonplace. Yet, theories regarding post-fire impacts derived from individual disciplines no longer apply in cases where human interactions are intense. A holistic approach that accounts for interactions between natural and human systems is necessary to understand the altered dynamics of post-fire landscapes. Focusing on the intersection of fire, water, and society, this paper explores an integrative research framework to couple post-fire fluvial and human processes. We review trends in wildfires and growing impacts on humans, how fluvial processes and systems are altered by wildfires, and the potential hazards for human settlements. This review forms a basis for integrating societal concerns, such as vulnerability, economic impacts, and management responses. We then link disciplinary questions into broad interdisciplinary research through an integrative framework. The 2012 Waldo Canyon Fire (Colorado, USA) provides an illustrative case with intense human interactions, both during and after the fire, to formulate critical questions within the integrative framework. Utilizing emergent integrative conceptual frameworks and tools will assist scholars in meeting the challenges and opportunities for broad collaboration, which are necessary to understand and confront wildfires characteristic of the “Anthropocene.”",,Alicia M.

Second, we describe the transition to a view of ICT literacy as a broad set of skills that have links to many traditional and non-traditional school subjects, and the move to technology integration in education. Third, we see the next transition for ICT literacy expressed as progress variables that are essential tools for the design of curriculum and assessments. Fourth, we discuss the impact of the “social network” perspective on ICT literacy—the critical need for building the power of virtual skills through proficiency with networks of people, information, tools, and resources.

article,CORKIN2022104642,"Digital divides occur when there are inequities in access to the benefits afforded by digital technologies. Originally conceptualised as inequitable access to digital technologies and internet, it is now recognised that the ways in which individuals use digital technologies and the competencies they subsequently develop may also contribute to digital divides. The aims of the current study were twofold. Firstly, to investigate categories of screen media use outside of school for children at age eight, and whether children of this age fall into “user typographies”, whereby different “modes” of digital technology use have already started to emerge. Secondly, to consider the implications of different modes of use at 8 years of age for the establishment of digital divides. Using a sample of 5010 children participating in the Growing Up in New Zealand study, the results of factor analysis indicated six categories of screen-based activities (Social, Creative, Shopping, Educational, Entertainment, and Interests), while four different modes of digital technology use were identified via cluster analysis (Creative, Entertainment, Emergent, and Limited). While Entertainment Users and Creative Users engaged with most activities on a fairly regularly basis, Emergent Users, and in particular, Limited Users, engaged with a narrower range of activities and at lower frequencies.

article,WANG2023100364,"The digitalization of higher education (HE) institutions and relevant issues have attracted the attention of many educational stakeholders. ICT has become a subject of high importance in every context, particularly in the workplace; thus, a principal goal for universities and schools is to prepare future professionals capable of dealing with problems and searching for effective solutions by their digital competence as a key skill. In this regard, a new framework is developed to evaluate the main drivers of digital transformation in higher education institutions (HEIs) in the era of industry 4.0. The developed framework is proposed a decision approach that can effectively use the presented information to make decisions of high rationality. This framework is applied to compute the subjective and objective criteria weights, and it is used to assess the preferences of organizations. An empirical case study to evaluate the main drivers for the implementation of digital transformation in HEIs is taken. According to the findings, the most significant drivers for the implementation of digital transformation in HEIs in the era of Industry 4.0 are developing, updating, and adapting a curriculum (0.0425), integration of digital technologies for universal education (0.0420), and cloud computing (0.0419), respectively. Hence, the evaluation results also show that the option higher education institution (HEI)-4 has the highest overall utility degree (1.845) over different drivers for the implementation of digital transformation in HEIs in the era of Industry 4.0.

Given numerous studies support the positive effects of games on learning, a growing number of researchers are committed to developing educational games to promote students’ 21st century skill development in schools. However, little is known regarding how games may influence student acquisition of 21st century skills. This paper examines the most recent literature in regard to game-based learning and identified 29 studies which targeted 21st century skills as outcomes. The range of game genres and game design elements as well as learning theories used in these studies are discussed, together with the range of indicators, measures and outcomes for impacts on 21st century skills. The findings suggest that a game-based learning approach might be effective in facilitating students’ 21st century skill development.

Relational thinking was evidenced across a range of subtraction calculation skill levels. Those students who could use both indirect addition and take-away strategies flexibly, depending on the size of the numbers involved, were more likely to evidence attention to generality with symbolic equations.

article,LEPRI2021102249,"Summary
Today's increased availability of large amounts of human behavioral data and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are contributing to a growing reliance on algorithms to make consequential decisions for humans, including those related to access to credit or medical treatments, hiring, etc. Algorithmic decision-making processes might lead to more objective decisions than those made by humans who may be influenced by prejudice, conflicts of interest, or fatigue. However, algorithmic decision-making has been criticized for its potential to lead to privacy invasion, information asymmetry, opacity, and discrimination. In this paper, we describe available technical solutions in three large areas that we consider to be of critical importance to achieve a human-centric AI: (1) privacy and data ownership; (2) accountability and transparency; and (3) fairness. We also highlight the criticality and urgency to engage multi-disciplinary teams of researchers, practitioners, policy makers, and citizens to co-develop and evaluate in the real-world algorithmic decision-making processes designed to maximize fairness, accountability, and transparency while respecting privacy.",,Bruno Lepri and Nuria Oliver and Alex Pentland,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102249,,,,2589-0042,iScience,"Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Privacy",,3,102249,,Ethical machines: The human-centric use of artificial intelligence,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004221002170,24,2021
article,ZHENG2020103669,"Engineering design is a complex process which requires science, technology, engineering, and mathematic (STEM) knowledge. Students' self-regulation plays a critical role in interdisciplinary tasks. However, there is limited research investigating whether and how self-regulation leads to different learning outcomes among students in engineering design. This study analyzes the engineering design behaviors of 108 ninth-grade U.S. students using principal component analysis and cluster analysis. It classifies the students into four distinct types: competent, cognitive-oriented, reflective-oriented, and minimally self-regulated learners. Competent self-regulated learners perceived themselves as the most self-regulated learners and had the greatest learning gains, although they did not perform best in the task. Cognitive-oriented self-regulated learners perceived themselves as the least self-regulated learners although they were the second best in both the performance of the task and learning gains. In contrast, reflective learners had the best performance in the task. Minimally self-regulated learners did not perform well in the task and had the lowest learning gains. The results revealed that the competent self-regulated learners had an appropriate assessment of themselves to obtain knowledge, cognitive-oriented self-regulated learners underestimated themselves, reflective learners focused on the results of the task, and minimally self-regulated learners overestimated themselves and exerted the least effort. The results also offer new insights into STEM education and self-regulated learning with emerging learning analytics.",,Juan Zheng and Wanli Xing and Gaoxia Zhu and Guanhua Chen and Henglv Zhao and Charles Xie,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103669,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"Self-regulation, STEM learning, Learning analytics, Energy3D, Engineering design",,,103669,,Profiling self-regulation behaviors in STEM learning of engineering design,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131519302222,143,2020
article,LIU20171,"Researchers and educators continuously remark on the importance of integrating creativity into the learning process. This study proposes a creativity approach to facilitating participatory learning for the sustained engagement of young learners based on the principle of remix practice, which consists of learning to generate online artefacts, endless hybridization and scaffolding. This study investigated students' engagement in and perceptions of the creative learning process during a two-year participatory learning program. Data collected included students’ flow perceptions during a 39-week activity, their motivation and creative self-efficacy before and after the intervention, as well as their creative products. The findings indicated that the remix-oriented approach led to a higher level of intrinsic motivation and sustained flow compared to a model-based approach, especially interest and curiosity, in this participatory learning program. The approach also helped the students to perceive a significant increase in their level of creative self-efficacy associated with strategies to generate creative ideas.

article,NEWHALL201753,"We present a model for incorporating parallel and distributed computing (PDC) throughout an undergraduate CS curriculum. Our curriculum is designed to introduce students early to parallel and distributed computing topics and to expose students to these topics repeatedly in the context of a wide variety of CS courses. The key to our approach is the development of a required intermediate-level course that serves as an introduction to computer systems and parallel computing. It serves as a requirement for every CS major and minor and is a prerequisite to upper-level courses that expand on parallel and distributed computing topics in different contexts. With the addition of this new course, we are able to easily make room in upper-level courses to add and expand parallel and distributed computing topics. The goal of our curricular design is to ensure that every graduating CS major has exposure to parallel and distributed computing, with both a breadth and depth of coverage.

article,RADIANTI2020103778,"Researchers have explored the benefits and applications of virtual reality (VR) in different scenarios. VR possesses much potential and its application in education has seen much research interest lately. However, little systematic work currently exists on how researchers have applied immersive VR for higher education purposes that considers the usage of both high-end and budget head-mounted displays (HMDs). Hence, we propose using systematic mapping to identify design elements of existing research dedicated to the application of VR in higher education. The reviewed articles were acquired by extracting key information from documents indexed in four scientific digital libraries, which were filtered systematically using exclusion, inclusion, semi-automatic, and manual methods. Our review emphasizes three key points: the current domain structure in terms of the learning contents, the VR design elements, and the learning theories, as a foundation for successful VR-based learning. The mapping was conducted between application domains and learning contents and between design elements and learning contents. Our analysis has uncovered several gaps in the application of VR in the higher education sphere—for instance, learning theories were not often considered in VR application development to assist and guide toward learning outcomes. Furthermore, the evaluation of educational VR applications has primarily focused on usability of the VR apps instead of learning outcomes and immersive VR has mostly been a part of experimental and development work rather than being applied regularly in actual teaching. Nevertheless, VR seems to be a promising sphere as this study identifies 18 application domains, indicating a better reception of this technology in many disciplines. The identified gaps point toward unexplored regions of VR design for education, which could motivate future work in the field.",,Jaziar Radianti and Tim A.

article,GONCHAROW2021316,"The NSF/IEEE-TCPP Parallel and Distributed Computing curriculum guidelines released in 2012 (PDC12) represents an effort to bring more parallel computing concepts into early computer science courses. To date, it has been moderately successful, with the inclusion of some PDC topics in the ACM/IEEE Computer Science curriculum guidelines in 2013 (CS13) and mentions of PDC topics in the Computing Curricula 2020. Additionally, some universities in the U.S. and around the world have started to cover some of these topics in early CS courses. Lack of knowledge of or training in PDC topics among instructors, along with the need to align early CS course content with prescribed learning objectives in the curricula, are often cited as hurdles for adoption in early CS courses. There have been attempts at bringing PDC materials, such as textbook chapters, lecture slides, assignments, and demos to assist instructors of early CS classes. However, the effort required on the part of the instructor to figure out what is relevant to a particular class can be daunting. In this work, we contend that simultaneously classifying pedagogical materials against the CS13 and the PDC12 curriculum guidelines can address some of the challenges faced by instructors and can promote broader adoption of PDC materials in early CS courses. We present CS Materials, a system that can be used to categorize pedagogical materials according to well-known and established curricular guidelines. We show that CS Materials can be leveraged 1) by instructors of early CS courses to find materials that are similar to the one that they use but that also cover PDC topics, and 2) by instructors to check the coverage of topics (and gaps) in a course, and 3) by PDC experts to identify topics for which PDC instructional materials do not exist or are insufficient in order to inform development of additional PDC curricular materials.",,Alec Goncharow and Matthew Mcquaigue and Erik Saule and Kalpathi Subramanian and Paula Goolkasian and Jamie Payton,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2021.05.014,,,,0743-7315,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,"cs education, Educational material recommendation, Integrating PDC in Early CS education, Analyzing the state of PDC education",,,316-330,,CS-Materials: A system for classifying and analyzing pedagogical materials to improve adoption of parallel and distributed computing topics in early CS courses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074373152100126X,157,2021

All commonly employed imaging modalities attempt to recapitulate this information in some useable form. Each technique, however, can only retrieve a small slice of spatial, temporal, or conceptual knowledge of the body area of interest. Furthermore, in some cases like computed tomography, a large amount of information is gathered without a clear strategy for manual or automated analysis. Current software developments are slowly realizing a convergence of medical imaging methodologies toward one of greater realism. For the purposes of this chapter, this “coming together” of disciplines will be delineated as the field of 3D graphics. Although this is a simplification, 3D graphics will be the primary foundation for a much larger hybridized field whose aim will be the creation of informative and accurate medical spatial representations. To understand how this will affect the clinical fields, we will need to first explore 3D graphics more holistically, delving into areas of physical simulation, 3D movie rendering, video game development, and the expansion of 3D visualization hardware.

article,WALSH2017228,"Wise humanising creativity (WHC) is creativity guided by ethical action, meaning it is mindful of its consequences and is empowering, offering far greater shared hope for the future than the competitive mentality that pervades most education systems. Understanding how virtual learning environments (VLEs) can foster WHC is becoming exceedingly important because it problematizes the marketisation of childhood and youth. It also offers new ways of considering educational futures including implications for the theoretical understanding of creativity within VLEs. We report on the theoretical development of the concept of WHC within C2Learn, a three-year project designing a digital gaming environment that provides children and young people with multiple opportunities to engage in co-creativity to foster their WHC. C2Learn is the first time WHC has actively been conceptualised in a digital context. We present our over-arching co-creativity conceptual framework which has been developed to frame the specific kind of co-creativity that is envisaged within C2Learn’s VLE. Drawing on that framework, we present a co-creativity assessment methodology specifically focused on evaluating the presence of WHC. We argue that leveraging WHC within VLEs broadens perspectives on the purposes of education, as this ethically framed creativity foregrounds the role of values in generating fundamental small-scale creative change through ‘journeys of becoming’ that have the potential to generate ‘quiet revolutions’ or small cumulative, incremental changes over time which are meaningful to a particular community.",,Chris Walsh and Kerry Chappell and Anna Craft,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsc.2017.01.001,,,,1871-1871,Thinking Skills and Creativity,"Creativity, Wise humanising creativity (WHC), CLearn, Co-creativity, Gameful learning design (GLD)",,,228-241,,A co-creativity theoretical framework to foster and evaluate the presence of wise humanising creativity in virtual learning environments (VLEs),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187117300056,24,2017

article,MACIASMACIAS2023106909,"Speech imagery has been successfully employed in developing Brain–Computer Interfaces because it is a novel mental strategy that generates brain activity more intuitively than evoked potentials or motor imagery. There are many methods to analyze speech imagery signals, but those based on deep neural networks achieve the best results. However, more research is necessary to understand the properties and features that describe imagined phonemes and words. In this paper, we analyze the statistical properties of speech imagery EEG signals from the KaraOne dataset to design a method that classifies imagined phonemes and words. With this analysis, we propose a Capsule Neural Network that categorizes speech imagery patterns into bilabial, nasal, consonant-vocal, and vowels/iy/ and/uw/. The method is called Capsules for Speech Imagery Analysis (CapsK-SI). The input of CapsK-SI is a set of statistical features of EEG speech imagery signals. The architecture of the Capsule Neural Network is composed of a convolution layer, a primary capsule layer, and a class capsule layer. The average accuracy reached is 90.88%±7 for bilabial, 90.15%±8 for nasal, 94.02%±6 for consonant–vowel, 89.70%±8 for word-phoneme, 94.33%± for/iy/ vowel and, 94.21%±3 for/uw/ vowel detection.

To address this challenge, we examined in detail the interaction between digital features and autistic children’s joint engagement in a real-world setting, exploring the impact of tangible constraints in fostering social interaction. The current study observed autistic children (aged between 12 and 15 years) playing with a digital robotic toy and a non-digital counterpart, and measured social attention and engagement during free play. The results showed that increased and higher levels of joint attention when children had to share a toy between them, on both digital and non-digital interfaces.

This study aimed to examine how imaginative capabilities act as a mediator between personality traits and academic performance, and to compare the different ways these factors affect engineering and science majors. The hypotheses were tested with data from five universities across different regions in Taiwan. The participants were a sample of 700 undergraduates, who were divided into engineering and science groups. The results showed that, through the mediator effect of imaginative capabilities, conscientiousness had the greatest impact on academic performance among engineering and science groups. Agreeableness was identified as the second major predictor of student performance in both groups. The influence of openness on student performance was slight and positive, whereas that of extraversion was slight and negative. The major differences in personality, imagination and performance structures between the two groups were the direct results of agreeableness, extraversion, initiating imagination, and conceiving imagination.",Oxford,C.

Many scholars share the assumption that leisure-time digital consumption is associated with computer science (CS) affinity, but there is a dearth of research evidence for this relationship. Female students generally spend less time on gaming and more time on social media than do male students, so a gender comparison perspective is helpful. Using multinomial logistic regression analysis on a national sample of 10,197 U.S. college students in introductory CS courses, we found that frequent computer gameplay was strongly associated with an increase in the probability of CS career interest relative to a Non-STEM career interest (β = -0.17, se = 0.06, p < .01) for both male (N = 7214) and female students (N = 2659).

article,WEINTROP201883,"There is growing diversity in the design of introductory programming environments. Where once all novices learned to program in conventional text-based languages, today, there exists a growing ecosystem of approaches to programming including graphical, tangible, and scaffolded text environments. To date, relatively little work has explored the relationship between the design of novice programming environments and the programming practices they engender in their users. This paper seeks to shed light on this dimension of learning to program through the careful analysis of novice programmers’ experiences learning with a hybrid block/text programming environment. Specifically, this paper is concerned with how novices leverage the various affordances designed into programming environments and programming languages to support their early efforts to author programs. We explore this relationship through the construct of modality using data from a study conducted in a high school computer science classroom in which students spent five weeks working in block-based, text-based, and hybrid block/text programming environments. This paper uses a detailed vignette of a novice writing a program in the hybrid environment as a way to characterize emerging programming practices, then presents analyses of programming trends from the full study population to speak to the generality of the practices identified in the vignette. The analyses focus not only on characterizing authoring strategies but also on identifying patterns in novices’ help-seeking behaviors.

article,KOUTROMANOS2023100028,"The research interest in the use of augmented reality smart glasses (ARSGs) has increased dramatically in recent years as they are utilised in many fields such as medicine and industry, as well as everyday life. This study aims to review the empirical research activity concerning the acceptance of ARSGs in all applicable fields. In total, 21 studies published from 2015 to 2022 have been reviewed. Their relative field, theoretical framework, methodological design, and the factors that were found to affect the acceptance or use of ARSGs were recorded. It was found that the research focuses more on users acting as consumers of the glasses than on professionals (e.g., doctors, teachers, athletes) using them in a specific field. Also, the majority of the studies base their theoretical framework either entirely or in part on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Moreover, the research models of these studies extend TAM by using various additional variables, such as privacy risk and external influence. Methodologically speaking, most of the studies follow the quantitative approach, without giving the participants the opportunity to interact with the glasses. In addition, the factors which were found to influence the acceptance or use of the glasses are varied and can be categorised as utilitarian, social, personal, risk-related, and technological. This review adds value to the theory of technology acceptance. This is because it is one of the first to address the acceptance or use of ARSGs. Since there is no acceptance model for ARSGs, the findings of this review could lead researchers to propose models for accepting ARSGs in various fields, such as education.",,George Koutromanos and Georgia Kazakou,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cexr.2023.100028,,,,2949-6780,Computers & Education: X Reality,"Augmented and virtual reality, Augmented reality smart glasses, Technology acceptance models, Review",,,100028,,Augmented reality smart glasses use and acceptance: Α literature review,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949678023000223,2,2023

article,SOUTHGATE201919,"Increasing numbers of children and young people are experiencing immersive virtual reality as part of leisure and schooling. Immersive virtual reality mediated through head-mounted displays presents significant challenges as well as tantalising opportunities for learning within schools. The purpose of this paper is to report on key issues that arose when embedding immersive virtual reality for learning into ICT and science classes in low-income high schools by providing a fine-grained account of how the research team negotiated scholarly and practical problems. The mixed method research used a participatory approach with teachers as co-researchers. Three areas are explored: (i) the ethical and safety issues of using IVR in classrooms; (ii) negotiating the organisational context of a school system and problem-solving within the context of institutional restrictions on internet access; and (iii) educational reflections on collaborative learning and gendered dynamics. We conclude that classrooms, as socially active and sometimes unpredictable places, yield unique and credible insights into the deployment of highly immersive virtual reality for learning.",,Erica Southgate and Shamus P.

article,FALLOON2019138,"Early research investigated young students' understandings of science concepts using physical equipment, but technological advances now mean there are new options to introduce these ideas, through devices such as iPads and simulations. However, research investigating the use of simulations in early years' science learning is limited. This study applied revisions of Kolb's Experiential Learning theoretical model to determine if age-indicated science simulations were effective for teaching 5 year olds simple circuit building procedures and electricity concepts, and the function of circuit components. It also explored whether their engagement with the simulations provided worthwhile opportunities to exercise higher order capabilities such as reflective thinking and abstraction – skills oftencited in literature as valuable outcomes from older student and adult use of simulations. Findings indicate students developed a solid base of procedural knowledge about constructing different circuits, and functional knowledge about circuit components they applied to different circuit designs. The emergence of tentative, generalised theories about current and the effects of different circuit designs on the performance of resistors - linked to the exercise of reflective and descriptive thinking, were also noted in many students. However, examples were found of some simulations appearing to foster common misconceptions, such as current being ‘consumed’ by resistors – indicating teachers need to be highly vigilant and work closely with students, to ensure accurate understandings are developed. Overall, with appropriate teacher support and careful selection and review, the study concludes simulations can be effective for introducing young students to simple physical science concepts, and for providing them with opportunities to engage in higher order thinking processes.",,Garry Falloon,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2019.03.001,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"Simulations, Young students, Electricity, Circuits, Experiential learning",,,138-159,,Using simulations to teach young students science concepts: An Experiential Learning theoretical analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013151930051X,135,2019

article,YOUNESCARDENAS20171,"Mangrove forests grow in the estuaries of 124 tropical countries around the world. Because in-situ monitoring of mangroves is difficult and time-consuming, remote sensing technologies are commonly used to monitor these ecosystems. Landsat satellites have provided regular and systematic images of mangrove ecosystems for over 30 years, yet researchers often cite budget and infrastructure constraints to justify the underuse this resource. Since 2001, over 50 studies have used Landsat or ASTER imagery for mangrove monitoring, and most focus on the spatial extent of mangroves, rarely using more than five images. Even after the Landsat archive was made free for public use, few studies used more than five images, despite the clear advantages of using more images (e.g. lower signal-to-noise ratios). The main argument of this paper is that, with freely available imagery and high performance computing facilities around the world, it is up to researchers to acquire the necessary programming skills to use these resources. Programming skills allow researchers to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as image acquisition and processing, consequently reducing up to 60% of the time dedicated to these activities. These skills also help scientists to review and re-use algorithms, hence making mangrove research more agile. This paper contributes to the debate on why scientists need to learn to program, not only to challenge prevailing approaches to mangrove research, but also to expand the temporal and spatial extents that are commonly used for mangrove research.",,Nicolás {Younes Cárdenas} and Karen E.

article,STRAWHACKER2020100212,"Biodesign, a speculative and creative offshoot from the field of bioengineering, is an area of STEM that is growing in popularity in education settings, primarily because of its unique interdisciplinary lens that connects STEM disciplinary knowledge and creative design practices. Although this trend is currently limited to middle school, high school, and higher education, prior research suggests that children 5 years and older, may yield long-term gains from exploring developmentally-appropriate concepts from novel STEM fields. Although there is little research on educational technologies or resources to support young children’s curiosity and learning in this novel domain, some research suggests that young children may already be forming preconceptions about genetics and biology (e.g., from popular media). Tangible technologies, which provide children qualitatively new, developmentally appropriate ways to engage with ideas and techniques, have been shown to support children’s engagement with foundational ideas relevant to biodesign, including the engineering design process. By applying developmentally appropriate constraints to our technology development (e.g., through frameworks such as the Positive Technological Development), the research team developed and evaluated a novel tangible technology called CRISPEE to introduce young children to concepts of biology and engineering. This article describes an experimental pilot study to investigate (1) how young children interact with the CRISPEE technological prototype, and (2) what prior knowledge the average child might bring to an educational biodesign activity.

article,SAIKKONEN2021104206,"Digital information skills are prerequisites for success in the information society. Previous research on 21st century skills has shown that digital skills evolve sequentially, building on digital information skills, making them the key to future skills that teachers should acquire and be able to pass on to future generations. In the research on digital skills, shortcomings of bivariate approaches have been widely identified and interest has largely shifted to multivariate methods. However, the development of effective targeted interventions still requires a deeper understanding of the social resources of individuals and the interdependencies of predictors. This study examined the extent to which sociodemographic factors and available resources predict digital information skills and which subgroups emerge as potential targets for interventions, by analysing the interdependence of the predictor variables. The empirical data used in the study consisted of 4988 Finnish teachers' questionnaire responses and performance test results. Utilising the multiple regression analysis, the study found that digital activity and age explain most of the variation in teachers' digital information skills. Their effect was found to be the inverse of each other, with abundant digital activity increasing and age reducing teachers’ mastery of these skills. Digital self-efficacy and in-service training also emerged as promising predictors, highlighting that teachers' information skills are explained more strongly by the available resources than by sociodemographic factors. At the end, the practical significance and recommendations for more targeted interventions as well as for further research are considered on the basis of the results obtained.",,Loretta Saikkonen and Meri-Tuulia Kaarakainen,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104206,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"Information literacy, Teacher professional development, 21st century abilities, Elementary education",,,104206,,Multivariate analysis of teachers’ digital information skills - The importance of available resources,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013152100083X,168,2021
article,MAGANA2014367,"Size and scale cognition is a critical aptitude associated with reasoning with concepts and systems in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). However, the teaching and learning of concepts related to size and scale present major challenges because objects at certain scales are unable to be perceived by humans with the naked eye. A potential way to overcome this challenge could be by means of learning strategies coupled with multimedia learning. In this study we propose learning strategies, instantiated by multimedia are for learning tools that may result in improved learning of size and scale cognition based on the FS2C framework. This framework consists of five levels to characterize size and scale cognition and the cognitive processes supporting them. Participants of this quasi-experimental design included 224 undergraduate students who experienced one of three different multimedia for learning tools, and then were assessed through five tasks whose design was based on the FS2C framework. Results suggest that learning strategies prompting students to compare objects of different sizes, may increase their abilities in ordering and classifying objects. Having students to interact with a logarithmic scale may also have increased participant posttest performance scores in the numerical proportional and absolute measurement tasks. Finally, we propose that the use of multimedia for learning affordances like 3D interaction, zoom in and zoom out, and direct interaction with a scale metaphor may help students make explicit connections and become familiar with objects of different sizes and scales.",,Alejandra J.

Children’s perceptions of and interactions with robots is a well-researched topic, but more focus is needed on the important role of play in Child–Robot Interaction. Play is essential to how children experience the world and thereby presents both opportunities and challenges for designers who aim to create positive experiences for children involving robots. We present a study investigating how a simple play-facilitating cardboard robot becomes a social interface and create meaningful and playful experiences for preschool children. We observed 214 children engaged in free play with the robot. The analysis produced four social interaction themes and five play patterns, illustrating the most salient reactions. The results show that the robot was successful in enabling play and that the children indeed treated the robot both as a social agent, but also as a material object. In line with existing research, our observations suggest that the children attributed both animate and inanimate properties to the robot, possibly explaining the duality of the observed playground behavior.

article,LITTS2021100295,"As researchers focus more on engaging youth with advanced technologies to build computational skills, there is a need to develop tools that support youth to become creators of digital content rather than consumers of these technologies. Scholars refer to this shift in becoming creators of technology as computational making, which enables new forms of learning and thinking at the intersection of the physical and the digital. The interdisciplinary and multidimensional nature of computational making design processes means learners must negotiate their design idea across space, time, mode, and expertise. In this paper, we draw on multiple iterations of design and implementation work with wearable and locative technologies to investigate the affordances and challenges of design scaffolds in youths’ computational making design processes. We present examples from learning with electronic textiles and locative game design to illustrate the unique problem spaces of materiality and spatiality specific to computational making.

However, most studies have followed a variable-centered approach, leaving open the question of how specific SRL (Self-regulated Learning) behaviors group within individual learners. Furthermore, little is known about how students' SRL profiles unfold over time in STEM education, specifically in the context of engineering design. In this study, we examined the change of students’ SRL profiles over time as 108 middle school students designed green buildings in a simulation-based computer-aided design (CAD) environment. We identified three distinct SRL profiles using a longitudinal clustering approach: reflective-oriented, adaptive, and minimally self-regulated learners. In addition, we found that students with different profile memberships differed significantly in their design performance. Specifically, adaptive self-regulated learners outperformed minimally self-regulated learners on design completeness, whereas reflective-oriented self-regulated learners demonstrated higher design efficiency than minimally self-regulated learners.

This allows for the management of professional output, the efficient interpretation of data, and completion of scientific research on data collected in geologically distinct regions. Machine learning methods and applications integrate large sets of information with the goal of efficient pattern recognition and the capability of leveraging accurate decision making. The objective of this study is to apply machine learning methods to the supervised classification of lithologies using multivariate log parameter data from offshore wells from the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). According to the analysis of the lithologies proposed in the IODP Expeditions and for the application of our methods, the lithologies were divided into four groups. The IODP Expeditions were organized into four templates for better results in analyzing the set of expeditions and practical application of the methods. The templates were submitted to training, validation, and testing by multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The evaluation was randomly divided into training (70%), validation (10%), and testing (20%) using the classification methods as an evaluation of the results. In the results, it was observed that Template1 (IODP Expedition 362) obtained better results with the MLP method, Template2 (IODP Expeditions 354, 355, and 359) and Template3 (IODP Expeditions 354, 355, 359, and 362) obtained better results with the random forest method with greater than 80.00% accuracy. For cross-validation, the random forest method performed well in all scenarios.

article,EIJKHOUT2018120,"Distributed memory programming, typically through the MPI library, is the de facto standard for programming large scale parallelism, with up to millions of individual processes. Its dominant paradigm of Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) programming is different from threaded and multicore parallelism, to an extent that students have a hard time switching models. In contrast to threaded programming, which allows for a view of the execution with central control and a central repository of data, SPMD programming has a symmetric model where all processes are active all the time, with none privileged, and where data is distributed. This model is counterintuitive to the novice parallel programmer, so care needs to be taken how to instill the proper ‘mental model’. Adoption of an incorrect mental model leads to broken or inefficient code. We identify problems with the currently common way of teaching MPI, and propose a structuring of MPI courses that is geared to explicit reinforcing the symmetric model.

article,JUNG2017291,"This study adopted a two (author: algorithm or journalist) by two (notification of author: real or inverse) between subject design to investigate how the public and journalists perceive the quality of algorithms-written articles compared with human journalist's work. Findings showed that both the public and journalists' evaluations were varied by the manipulation of author notification. That is, the public gave higher scores to the algorithm's work when it was notified as the real author, but they gave lower scores to the algorithm's work when the author was notified as a journalist. It confirmed the public's negative attitude toward journalists' credibility and craving for new information and communication technology (ICT) products/services in Korea. Based on journalists' resistance to change and innovation and the theory of prejudice, it was expected that journalists would be favorable to another journalist's work and unfavorable to an algorithm's work. However, contrary to the hypothetical expectation, journalists also gave higher scores to an algorithm's work and lower scores to a journalist's work. Implications relating to the intrusion of algorithm-written articles into journalism were discussed.",,Jaemin Jung and Haeyeop Song and Youngju Kim and Hyunsuk Im and Sewook Oh,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2017.02.022,,,,0747-5632,Computers in Human Behavior,"Robot journalism, Journalist, Algorithms, Technology adoption, Ingroup-outgroup distinction",,,291-298,,Intrusion of software robots into journalism: The public's and journalists' perceptions of news written by algorithms and human journalists,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074756321730095X,71,2017
article,CHEN2023100184,"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is penetrating in various social sectors, motivating a strong need for teaching AI literacy in younger generations. While substantial efforts have been made to teach AI literacy and to use AI to facilitate learning, few studies have provided empirical accounts of students' nuanced processes of using GenAI for learning. In this study, we engaged a group of high school students in leveraging ChatGPT to support their knowledge building efforts. Following the teacher's pedagogical design, students used ChatGPT for a range of distinct purposes. Student interviews showed detailed processes of using ChatGPT for knowledge building and students' emerging AI literacy in multiple dimensions. This study offers practical implications for the integration of GenAI in K-12 education and urges educators to create spaces and scaffolds for students to mindfully engage with GenAI in the classroom.",,Bodong Chen and Xinran Zhu and Fernando {Díaz del Castillo H.},,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2023.100184,,,,2666-920X,Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence,"Generative AI, ChatGPT, Knowledge building, Human-AI partnership",,,100184,,Integrating generative AI in knowledge building,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X23000632,5,2023
