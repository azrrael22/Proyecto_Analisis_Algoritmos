article,SMITH2023100616,"The article proposes a research agenda for computational empowerment for emerging technologies in the field of child–computer interaction (CCI) – in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), the internet of things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). This research agenda includes three levels of operation for future studies: (1) participatory practice, capable of engaging teachers and students in co-developing and designing approaches for teaching and learning emerging technologies, (2) educational principles for integrating technological and societal aspects of emerging technologies, and (3) digital tools for engaging students in construction of and critical reflection on emerging technologies. The research agenda was developed from longitudinal studies of the respective emerging technologies in Danish K–12 education, participatory design research with in-service teachers, development of novel tools and technologies, and literature studies of current CCI research.

article,WANG2024100646,"The study aims to develop a music-driven dance teaching game that enhances players' dance learning. By utilizing a multi-feature fusion strategy, the game creates dance movements inspired by music. The model effectively combines music and dance features to generate various dance sequences. In performance tests, the research model successfully matches the tempo and intensity of the music with the generated dance. Overall, this approach improves players' dance movement learning ability. The teaching effectiveness of the research method is significantly superior, with an average value of 95.23 points in the teaching evaluation. In terms of running time, for simple dances, the average generation time is 10 s; for ordinary categories of dances, the average generation time is 15 s; for complex dances, the average generation time is 17 s. The fluency of the generated dances is 97.21 %. The study's findings confirm the effectiveness of the research method.

article,AKINYEMI2022e01242,"ABSTRACT
Electron surface dissipation and quantum-limited size tend to control the material properties of exterior plasmon oscillation as the size of metal nanoparticles goes into the nanoscale domain. The need to examine this characteristic behaviour and its potential becomes imperative. This study explores the effects of the damping constant of electrons and size quantum-based frequency-dependent dielectric function (FDDF) of small metallic materials using an elementary model of electrons in a confined box. The frequency-dependent dielectric function is employed to study quantum size impacts and damping constant in the optical spectra region. The quantum amended frequency-dependent dielectric function and the absorbing spectra of silver-cube geometry for different sizes by adding damping constant and without damping constant are critically examined. The findings reveal that when the damping constant effect is absent, the multiple crests emerge for the quantum-amended frequency-dependent dielectric function and absorbing spectra of the metallic materials, highlighting the electronic discretization levels in the tiny quantum-limited structure. While the damping constant is included, the multiple summits are hidden and vanish owing to a considerable widening of the structures independently. The change in the numerical results from the quantum case to the classical case for growing widths is further illustrated for both cases. The numerical results enhance our knowledge of damping constant dissipation and quantum limited-size impact in small-scaled plasmonic devices.",,Lateef Akinyemi and Sunday Oladejo and Stephen Ekwe and Agbotiname Lucky Imoize and Stephen Abiodun Ojo,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2022.e01242,,,,2468-2276,Scientific African,"Damping constant, Frequency-dependent dielectric function (FDDF), Models, Surface Plasmon, Plasmonic devices",,,e01242,,,Effects of Damping Constant of Electron and Size on Quantum-Based Frequency-dependent Dielectric Function of Small Metallic Plasmonic Devices,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468227622001491,16,2022

article,KASONGO2023113,"In recent years, the spike in the amount of information transmitted through communication infrastructures has increased due to the advances in technologies such as cloud computing, vehicular networks systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), etc. As a result, attackers have multiplied their efforts for the purpose of rendering network systems vulnerable. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to improve the security of those network systems. In this study, an IDS framework using Machine Learning (ML) techniques is implemented. This framework uses different types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), namely, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Simple RNN. To assess the performance of the proposed IDS framework, the NSL-KDD and the UNSW-NB15 benchmark datasets are considered. Moreover, existing IDSs suffer from low test accuracy scores in detecting new attacks as the feature dimension grows. In this study, an XGBoost-based feature selection algorithm was implemented to reduce the feature space of each dataset. Following that process, 17 and 22 relevant attributes were picked from the UNSW-NB15 and NSL-KDD, respectively. The accuracy obtained through the test subsets was used as the main performance metric in conjunction with the F1-Score, the validation accuracy, and the training time (in seconds). The results showed that for the binary classification tasks using the NSL-KDD, the XGBoost-LSTM achieved the best performance with a test accuracy (TAC) of 88.13%, a validation accuracy (VAC) of 99.49% and a training time of 225.46 s. For the UNSW-NB15, the XGBoost-Simple-RNN was the most efficient model with a TAC of 87.07%. For the multiclass classification scheme, the XGBoost-LSTM achieved a TAC of 86.93% over the NSL-KDD and the XGBoost-GRU obtained a TAC of 78.40% over the UNSW-NB15 dataset.

article,KIM202348,"Purpose
Self-report of sensitive or stigmatized health states is often subject to social desirability and interviewer biases. To reduce such biases, we estimated the rate of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) using a list experiment.
Methods
This population-representative study was nested within the Dar es Salaam Urban Cohort Study, a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in the Ukonga ward of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Men and women aged ≥40years were randomly assigned to receive a list of either four control items (i.e., the control group) or four control items plus an additional item on having had a disease through sexual contacts in the past 12months (i.e., the treatment group). We calculated the mean difference in the total number of items to which respondents answered “yes” in the treatment versus control group and compared this prevalence estimate to the one measured by the direct question.
Results
A total of 2310 adults aged ≥40years were enrolled in the study: 32% were male and 48% were aged 40–49years. The estimated prevalence of having STIs in the past 12months was 17.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.3–23.3) in the list experiment, almost 10 times higher than the estimated prevalence of 1.8% (95%CI 1.3–2.4) based on the direct question (P < .001). STI prevalence remained high after adjusting for age, the number of lifetime sex partners, alcohol consumption and smoking in multivariate linear regression (15.6%; 95% CI 7.3–23.9).
Conclusions
We found a substantially higher prevalence of STIs among older adults in urban Tanzania when we based our estimation on a list experiment rather than a direct question in a population-representative survey. List experiments should be considered to elimnate social desirability and interviewer biases in surveys of sensitive or stigmatized health states. The very high prevalence of STIs highlights the need for improved access to STI screening, prevention and treatment for older adults in urban Africa.",,Hae-Young Kim and Julia Rohr and Germana Henry Leyna and Japhet Killewo and Andrew Tomita and Frank Tanser and Till Bärnighausen,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2023.05.001,,,,1047-2797,Annals of Epidemiology,"List experiment, Sexually transmitted diseases, Prevalence, Older adults, Tanzania",,,48-53,,,High prevalence of self-reported sexually transmitted infections among older adults in Tanzania: results from a list experiment in a population-representative survey,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047279723000868,84,2023

article,BRIAN2023129074,"We introduce mindset streams for assessing ways of bridging two target concepts in concept maps. We focus on behavioural forma mentis networks (BFMN), which map the associative and affective dimensions of memory recalls. Inspired by trains of thoughts taking several paths to link ideas, mindset streams are defined as BFMN subgraphs induced by all shortest paths between two target concepts, e.g. all recalls in shortest paths bridging “math” and “learning”. These streams quantify the following features of the mindset encoded in a BFMN: (i) semantic content (i.e. which ideas mediate connections between targets?), (ii) valence coherence/conflict (i.e. are connections mediated by entwining ideas perceived negatively, positively or neutrally?), and (iii) semantic relevance (i.e. are the bridges between targets peripheral or central for the connectivity/betweenness of the BFMN?). We investigate mindset streams between ‘maths”/“physics” and key motivational aspects of learning (“fun”, “work”, “failure”) in two BFMNs, encoding how 159 students and 59 experts perceived and associated concepts about Science Technology Engineering and Maths (STEM), respectively. Statistical comparisons against configuration models show that high schoolers bridge “maths” and “fun” only through overabundant levels of valence-conflicting associations, contrasting negatively perceived domain knowledge with peer-related positive experiences. This conflict is absent in the researchers’ mindset stream, which rather bridges “math” and “fun” through positive, science-related associations. The mindset streams of both groups bridge “maths” and “physics” to “work” through mostly positive career-related jargon. Students’ mindset streams of “failure” and “math”/“physics” are dominated by negative associations with test anxiety, whereas researchers integrate “failure” and “math”/“physics” in semantically richer and more positive contexts, denoting failure itself as a cornerstone of STEM learning.

This paper presents a comprehensive toolkit that can help educators teach programming with an emphasis on collaboration, and provides suggestions for its effective pedagogical implementation. The toolkit comprises the Talkoo kit with physical computing plug-and-play modules and a visual programming environment. The key suggestions are inspired by the results of the evaluation studies which show that children (aged 14–18 in a sample group of 34 students) are well motivated when working with the toolkit but lack confidence in the kit’s support for collaborative learning. If the intention is to move beyond tools and code in computer education to community and context, thus encouraging computational participation, collaboration should be considered as a key aspect of physical computing activities.

To maintain and improve students' learning motivation and interest, and more effectively carry out personalized teaching capabilities, research focuses on students' personalized knowledge structure. Starting from tracking the differences in knowledge structures among different learners, a game model based on entrepreneurial education theory has been designed. Through modeling learner knowledge using Bayesian network, the research constructs a game framework of entrepreneurial education for adaptive learning. On this basis, a new feature crossover method is proposed to construct a deep knowledge tracking model based on feature embedding and attention mechanism. It was combined with adaptive learning technology to ultimately construct an entrepreneurial education game model that integrates adaptive learning and improved deep knowledge tracking. A total of 379 students participated in the experiment. The experimental results on the ASSISTments09 open data set show that the area value under the receptivity curve of this model is 0.913, which is 8.8% to 26.6% higher than that of advanced models of the same type. The performance of the research model is optimal on different training scale data.

We had three research questions focused on children's game play: 1) How does the structure of each game influence children's play? 2) Do children play more or less independently depending on the game they play? 3) Do children who play the games more independently learn more coding skills? Three researchers coded more than 6 h of video data showing children's play with digital coding games. Findings include, that the type of game did influence the different ways that children behaved while playing. However, during both games, children had the same amount of independent play. Children who played more independently during Daisy the Dinosaur learned more coding skills. This may be because these children were focusing more on the game than their peers as we did not find a similar effect for the game Kodable. We discuss the ways that children play structured vs. open structured (i.e., sandbox) digital games with a particular focus on how game play may influence learning.

article,OLADEJO2024111880,"In this paper, a novel metaheuristic called ‘The Hiking Optimization Algorithm’ (HOA) is proposed. HOA is inspired by hiking, a popular recreational activity, in recognition of the similarity between the search landscapes of optimization problems and the mountainous terrains traversed by hikers. HOA’s mathematical model is premised on Tobler’s Hiking Function (THF), which determines the walking velocity of hikers (i.e. agents) by considering the elevation of the terrain and the distance covered. THF is employed in determining hikers’ positions in the course of solving an optimization problem. HOA’s performance is demonstrated by benchmarking with 29 well-known test functions (including unimodal, multimodal, fixed-dimension multimodal, and composite functions), three engineering design problems (EDPs), (including I-beam, tension/compression spring, and gear train problems) and two N-P Hard problems (i.e. Traveling Salesman’s and Knapsack Problems). Moreover, HOA’s results are verified by comparison to 14 other metaheuristics, including Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm Optimization, Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) as well as newly introduced algorithms such as Komodo Mlipir Algorithm (KMA), Quadratic Interpolation Optimization (QIO), and Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm (COVIDOA). In this study, we employ statistical tests such as the Wilcoxon rank sum, Friedman test, and Dunn’s post hoc test for the performance evaluation.

article,HUGHESROBERTS2020103988,"Digital game making is becoming an increasingly common means of learning in schools due to the appeal of delivering curriculum-based learning objectives while tapping into the popularity of videogames. Indeed, research suggests that digital game making may improve cognitive and behavioral skills in learners and this may have significant impact on learners with special education needs and disabilities (SEND). However, past work in digital game making has limited involvement with learners with SEND, focuses on short-term evaluations and is utilised during extra-curricular sessions with few studies using an action-based field research approach. Furthermore, there is little quantitative data from defined methodologies that demonstrate the impact of digital game-making on learning. This paper presents results from two field trials examining the use of digital game making in two schools (one mixed ability primary and one special school) to deliver national curriculum-based content over 8-weeks. Results from a feasibility trial informed a pedagogical design and identified evaluation metrics for a subsequent longer trial. Evaluation metrics included learner engagement and collaboration with peers as suitable indicators of inclusive learning. Impact on these metrics was measured using an in-class observation tool that sampled learner behavior yielding quantitative data and follow up interviews with teachers yielding qualitative data. Results suggest that digital game making is at least as effective in encouraging engagement and collaboration in learners when compared to traditional methods, with it being more engaging for learners with special needs. Contributions from this paper provide quantifiable evidence for the perceived benefits of using digital game making and a methodology for evaluating engagement and collaboration through classroom observation.

article,VERDUZCO2022103189,"It is presented the development and implementation of a new computed aided learning MatLab Toolbox for the design of reinforced concrete structures named as CALRECOD for their abbreviation Computer Aided Learning of Reinforced Concrete Design. Such development emerges as the result of a series of research works in the Autonomous University of Queretaro with the main purpose of improving the way in which the design of reinforced concrete structures is taught in high education institutions. CALRECOD uses optimization methods and algorithms to aid students in their design interaction learning so that they are able to compare their own designs and what commercial software delivers with optimal ones given certain load conditions on the elements or structures. The software consists almost entirely of MatLab functions (.m files) and the ACI 318-19 code is taken as their main design reference to make it internationally useful, although in some cases the Mexican code NTC-17 specifications are used. Besides MatLab functions, the software consists as well of ANSYS SpaceClaim script functions (.scscript files) as an additional tool for the aid in the visualization of design results in a 3D space in the software ANSYS SpaceClaim. CALRECOD has proven to be versatile, flexible and of easy use with a huge potential to increase learning outcomes for students in high education programs related with the design of reinforced concrete structures as well as to enhance the creation of efficient interactive environments for researchers and academics focused on the development of new design and analysis methods for such structures. With their optimization design functions, a solid comparison platform of designs’ performance could be laid out, and with its extended function design packages for structural systems, reinforced concrete design courses could be enhanced in a great deal regarding their program content’s scope.

article,CELLA2024107262,"Background
Italy was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, experiencing multiple waves of infection following the sequential emergence of new variants. Understanding the transmission patterns and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is vital for future preparedness.
Methods
We conducted an analysis of viral genome sequences, integrating epidemiological and phylodynamic approaches, to characterize how SARS-CoV-2 variants have spread within the country.
Results
Our findings indicate bidirectional international transmission, with Italy transitioning between importing and exporting the virus. Italy experienced four distinct epidemic waves, each associated with a significant reduction in fatalities from 2021 to 2023. These waves were primarily driven by the emergence of VOCs such as Alpha, Delta, and Omicron, which were reflected in observed transmission dynamics and effectiveness of public health measures.
Conclusions
The changing patterns of viral spread and variant prevalence throughout Italy's pandemic response underscore the continued importance of flexible public health strategies and genomic surveillance, both of which are crucial for tracking the evolution of variants and adapting control measures effectively to ensure preparedness for future outbreaks.",,Eleonora Cella and Vagner Fonseca and Francesco Branda and Stephane Tosta and Keldenn Moreno and Gabriel Schuab and Sobur Ali and Svetoslav Nanev Slavov and Fabio Scarpa and Luciane Amorim Santos and Simone Kashima and Eduan Wilkinson and Houriiyah Tegally and Carla Mavian and Alessandra Borsetti and Francesca Caccuri and Marco Salemi and Tulio {de Oliveira} and Taj Azarian and Ana Maria Bispo {de Filippis} and Luiz Carlos Junior Alcantara and Giancarlo Ceccarelli and Arnaldo Caruso and Vittorio Colizzi and Alessandro Marcello and José Lourenço and Massimo Ciccozzi and Marta Giovanetti,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2024.107262,,,,1201-9712,International Journal of Infectious Diseases,"SARS-CoV-2, D614G variant, Italy, pandemic, genomic epidemiology",,,107262,,,"Integrated analyses of the transmission history of SARS-CoV-2 and its association with molecular evolution of the virus underlining the pandemic outbreaks in Italy, 2019-2023",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971224003333,,2024
article,RAMIREZMONTOYA202432,"Purpose
The challenges facing 21st-century society are becoming increasingly complex, requiring the development of new citizen competencies. This study aims to validate an educational model focused on developing complex thinking in higher education students. Current educational models lack future-ready competencies, necessitating the emergence of new models to guide future generations toward the common good.
Design/methodology/approach
This was an adaptation of the causal-layered analysis (CLA) applied to 415 participants from higher education institutions in Mexico, Panama and Spain. Sessions were designed to present the proposed educational model and explore participants’ perceptions of its significance and contributions to future education.
Findings
Key findings include the following: participants perceived complexity as difficult and challenging; causes of problems were linked to outdated educational models requiring replacement by those that develop students’ competencies; participants envisioned changes that would develop individuals capable of understanding and transforming society; and participants recognized the model’s transformative potential, offering a novel proposal for 21st-century education.
Originality/value
This research sought to gather opinions from different stakeholders using the CLA methodology, providing a deep understanding of participants’ perspectives on the proposed solution.",,María-Soledad Ramírez-Montoya and May Portuguez-Castro,,https://doi.org/10.1108/OTH-12-2023-0042,,,,1074-8121,On the Horizon,"Complex thinking, Educational innovation, Higher education, Educational model",,1,32-48,,,Expanding horizons for the future with an open educational model for complex thinking: external and internal validation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074812124000034,32,2024
article,XU2024101574,"In the 21st century, the requirements for talent abilities are becoming increasingly diversified. Traditional skill learning methods cannot meet this demand, while complex learning can adapt to this demand for talent. In complex learning systems, various factors such as instructional theory, instructional interventions, and technology work together to facilitate the acquisition of complex thinking or operational skills. However, the effectiveness of instructional factors in complex skills learning remains unknown. To find out the effects of these factors on the acquisition of different complex skills, this meta-analysis includes 60 empirical studies and the effectiveness of 4C/ID model, instructional interventions and technical support on different complex learning are investigated. Complex skills learning had a moderate positive overall effect in acquiring complex skills: g = 0.67, 95% CI [0.49, 0.85]. Both thinking skills (g = 0.69, 95% CI [0.44, 0.94], k = 40) and operational skills (g = 0.64, 95% CI [0.38, 0.89], k = 20) showed moderate positive effects, and there was small but not statistically significant difference in the effect sizes between the two groups. Funnel plot, Egger's test and Rank Correlation Test results show that the findings were likely not to be affected by publication bias. We conclude that: compared to traditional learning, (1) the 4C/ID model is more suitable for thinking skills learning and has a significant large positive promotion effect. (2) Different instructional interventions can play a positive role in promoting the learning of complex skills. Learning scaffolding and learning platforms and tools are more suitable for operational skills learning, while thinking skills learning can benefit more from the adjustment of instructional models. (3) A variety of technologies can have a high effect on facilitating complex thinking and operational skills. These results show that different instructional interventions and technical support play a vital role in the learning of complex skills. In practical application, we need to make reasonable selection and application according to the specific educational situation and complex skills.",,Haoxin Xu and Tianrun Deng and Xianlong Xu and Xiaoqing Gu,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsc.2024.101574,,,,1871-1871,Thinking Skills and Creativity,"Complex learning, Thinking skills, Operational skills, Meta-analysis",,,101574,,,The effectiveness of educational interventions on thinking and operational skills in complex learning—A meta-analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187124001123,53,2024

In this scenario, new educational technology tools and immersive learning affordances (possibilities), offer unprecedented potential for the design of smart and dynamic learning systems and contexts that can enhance learning processes across varied audiences and educational settings. However, current STEAM education practice lacks attention to equipping all citizens with the necessary skills to use digital technologies in an ethical, critical and creative way. This gap calls for attention in design processes, principles and practices that are attentive to ethical considerations and values-based approaches. On the other hand, in its formulation STEAM as an educational approach is framed in four fundamental pillars: creativity, inclusion, citizenship and emerging technologies, which also put attention on the inclusion of disadvantaged and underrepresented social groups during STEAM education design. Following an apparent need to explore ethical and inclusive design in STEAM education, and inspired in the 4E cognition framework, ethical enactivism and embodied and ecosomaesthetics experience design, here we propose a theoretical framework grounded on systems thinking for the design of smart and dynamic STEAM learning systems and settings.

article,MOODLEY2022e1855,"Summary
Data sharing in research is fraught with controversy. Academic success is premised on competitive advantage, with research teams protecting their research findings until publication. Research funders, by contrast, often require data sharing. Beyond traditional research and funding requirements, surveillance data have become contentious. Public health emergencies involving pathogens require intense genomic surveillance efforts and call for the rapid sharing of data on the basis of public interest. Under these circumstances, timely sharing of data becomes a matter of scientific integrity. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the transformative potential of genomic pathogen data sharing became obvious and advanced the debate on data sharing. However, when the genomic sequencing data of the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant was shared and announced by scientists in southern Africa, various challenges arose, including travel bans. The scientific, economic, and moral impact was catastrophic. Yet, travel restrictions failed to mitigate the spread of the variant already present in countries outside Africa. Public perceptions of the negative effect of data sharing are detrimental to the willingness of research participants to consent to sharing data in postpandemic research and future pandemics.

In this study, we provide a retrospective reconstruction of the Zika virus transmission dynamics in the state of Goiás by analyzing genomic data from areas in Midwest Brazil not covered by other previous studies.
ABSTRACT
Since the introduction of the Zika virus (ZIKV) into Brazil in 2015, its transmission dynamics have been intensively studied in many parts of the country, although much is still unknown about its circulation in the midwestern states. Here, using nanopore technology, we obtained 23 novel partial and near-complete ZIKV genomes from the state of Goiás, located in the Midwest of Brazil. Genomic, phylogenetic, and epidemiological approaches were used to retrospectively explore the spatiotemporal evolution of the ZIKV-Asian genotype in this region. As a likely consequence of a gradual accumulation of herd immunity, epidemiological data revealed a decline in the number of reported cases over 2018 to 2021. Phylogenetic reconstructions revealed that multiple independent introductions of the Asian lineage have occurred in Goiás over time and revealed a complex transmission dynamic between epidemic seasons. Together, our results highlight the utility of genomic, epidemiological, and evolutionary methods to understand mosquito-borne epidemics.
IMPORTANCE Despite the considerable morbidity and mortality of arboviral infections in Brazil, such as Zika, chikungunya, dengue fever, and yellow fever, our understanding of these outbreaks is hampered by the limited availability of genomic data to track and control the epidemic. In this study, we provide a retrospective reconstruction of the Zika virus transmission dynamics in the state of Goiás by analyzing genomic data from areas in Midwest Brazil not covered by other previous studies. Our study provides an understanding of how ZIKV initiates transmission in this region and reveals a complex transmission dynamic between epidemic seasons.

To effectively promote and implement programming in K–12 education, it is necessary to understand school principals' perception of programming education. This study adopted a mixed methods design to explain principals’ understanding, expectations, and support for programming education in primary schools using Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). In study 1, survey questionnaires were distributed to all principals from public primary schools in Hong Kong. Two hundred and sixty-six principals responded to the survey (response rate = 55.6%). In study 2, a follow-up interview study with 13 principals was conducted to further explore their perception of programming education. The results of study 1 indicated that principals with a better understanding of programming education tend to have clearer expectations of how to implement programming education in their schools, which consequently leads to greater support for the implementation of programming education. In study 2, the thematic analysis further supported the results obtained in study 1.

Still, children are often not included in this discussion, while there is much to learn from current uses and children's understandings of AI and robotics. The study is based on a seven-month ethnographical work that details the implementation of a robot in two preschool groups of children aged 1–2 and 3–5 (n = 38). The study descriptively combines a framework for children's play analysis with explorative qualitative child interviews (n = 6) with the 3-5-year-olds to examine how children play with the robot and their thinking about a future with robots and AI. The results show how children's play with robots spans all of Hughes's (2011) sixteen play types and integrates robots into play in ways specific to child-robot interaction. The interviews indicate that children have well-formed knowledge about the current uses of robots and AI and elaborate imaginaries about a future with them, including critical boundaries toward robots and AI agents. The evidence shows emerging ways children relate to these.

article,HOWLAND2015224,"Teaching basic computational concepts and skills to school children is currently a curricular focus in many countries. Running parallel to this trend are advances in programming environments and teaching methods which aim to make computer science more accessible, and more motivating. In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of Flip, a programming language that aims to help 11–15 year olds develop computational skills through creating their own 3D role-playing games. Flip has two main components: 1) a visual language (based on an interlocking blocks design common to many current visual languages), and 2) a dynamically updating natural language version of the script under creation. This programming-language/natural-language pairing is a unique feature of Flip, designed to allow learners to draw upon their familiarity with natural language to “decode the code”. Flip aims to support young people in developing an understanding of computational concepts as well as the skills to use and communicate these concepts effectively. This paper investigates the extent to which Flip can be used by young people to create working scripts, and examines improvements in their expression of computational rules and concepts after using the tool. We provide an overview of the design and implementation of Flip before describing an evaluation study carried out with 12–13 year olds in a naturalistic setting. Over the course of 8 weeks, the majority of students were able to use Flip to write small programs to bring about interactive behaviours in the games they created. Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in their computational communication after using Flip (as measured by a pre/post-test). An additional finding was that girls wrote more, and more complex, scripts than did boys, and there was a trend for girls to show greater learning gains relative to the boys.",,Kate Howland and Judith Good,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2014.08.014,,,,0360-1315,Computers & Education,"Evaluation of CAL systems, Interactive learning environments, Programming and programming languages, Secondary education",,,224-240,,,Learning to communicate computationally with Flip: A bi-modal programming language for game creation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013151400195X,80,2015
article,MISHRA2024108508,"Information and communication technologies play a significant role in all aspects of modern society. It has become a subject of high significance in all perspectives, mainly in the workstation. Consequently, the main objective for universities and schools is to develop future specialists for handling the problems and finding the effective outcomes by their digital competency as a significant ability. In higher education institutions, assessing the key drivers of digital transformation is a complicated decision-making problem as the multiple factors are involved in it. To this aim, a novel picture fuzzy information-based decision-making framework is proposed to assess the key drivers of digital transformation in higher education institutions. In this regard, an improved score function is proposed to rank the picture fuzzy numbers. In addition, it is used to determine the weights of decision experts. Next, some generalized Dombi aggregation operators are proposed to aggregate the picture fuzzy information. Further, an integrated criteria weighting model is presented based on the combination of objective weights through standard deviation-based model and subjective weights through pivot pairwise relative criteria importance assessment (PIPRECIA) model in the context of picture fuzzy sets. To rank the alternatives, a picture fuzzy extension of alternative ranking order model accounting for two step normalization (AROMAN) approach is proposed using the score function, Dombi operators and integrated weighting model. The usefulness of the proposed approach is illustrated using a case study of key drivers' assessment of digital transformation in higher education institutions. Sensitivity and comparative analyses are discussed to reveal the consistency, robustness and efficiency of introduced model. This study offers a new decision-making framework, which makes a significant contribution to the key drivers’ assessment process from uncertainty perspective.",,Arunodaya Raj Mishra and Pratibha Rani and Dragan Pamucar and Adel Fahad Alrasheedi and Vladimir Simic,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2024.108508,,,,0952-1976,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,"Digital transformation, Picture fuzzy sets, Higher education institutions, DSS, PIPRECIA",,,108508,,,An integrated picture fuzzy standard deviation and pivot pairwise assessment method for assessing the drivers of digital transformation in higher education institutions,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197624006663,133,2024
incollection,ADAMS2024593,"Quantum biology is, most simply, the investigation of quantum effects in biological systems. While all matter is fundamentally quantum, quantum biology focuses on those quantum effects that result in properties of biological scale and relevance. It has long been argued that quantum effects are incompatible with biological systems, due to the likelihood of decoherence. But nature is a surprising and enterprising engineer. In this sense, quantum biology is the study of nature's materials and how they might sustain and enhance quantum effects, even in hot and wet environments. Quantum mechanics was developed in response to seemingly anomalous interactions between light and matter. It seems fitting that a great deal of the progress made in quantum biology in the last few decades has been on the topic of photosynthesis: the interaction of light with living matter. The interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter is also at the heart of many other topics of quantum biology. This review is a broad overview of the current state of this research. While the underlying quantum effects are often similar—energy and charge transfer, tunnelling, spin dynamics—the biological contexts are varied and continue to grow. These contexts include enzyme catalysis, DNA mutation, receptor binding, photosynthesis, microtubule and mitochondrial function, magnetoreception, regulation of the production of reactive oxygen species, calcium ion storage and release and, potentially, consciousness. While there remain a number of reservations regarding quantum biology, progress made in this regard might further our understanding of both quantum and biological systems. With respect to the latter, advances in understanding biology might also contribute to a better understanding of physiology and the development of new therapeutics.

article,WU2024100295,"There is growing recognition among researchers and stakeholders about the significant impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technology on classroom instruction. As a crucial element in developing AI literacy, AI education in K-12 schools is increasingly gaining attention. However, most existing research on K-12 AI education relies on experiential methodologies and suffers from a lack of quantitative analysis based on extensive classroom data, hindering a comprehensive depiction of AI education's current state at these educational levels. To address this gap, this article employs the advanced semantic understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to create an intelligent analysis framework that identifies learning theories, pedagogical approaches, learning tools, and levels of AI literacy in AI classroom instruction. Compared with the results of manual analysis, analysis based on LLMs can achieve more than 90% consistency. Our findings, based on the analysis of 98 classroom instruction videos in central Chinese cities, reveal that current AI classroom instruction insufficiently foster AI literacy, with only 35.71% addressing higher-level skills such as evaluating and creating AI. AI ethics are even less commonly addressed, featured in just 5.1% of classroom instruction. We classified AI classroom instruction into three categories: conceptual (50%), heuristic (18.37%), and experimental (31.63%).

The research findings revealed both the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT usage, as perceived by the students. The students stated that the main benefits of using ChatGPT in programming learning are providing fast and mostly correct answers to questions, improving thinking skills, facilitating debugging, and increasing self-confidence. On the other hand, the main limitations of using ChatGPT in programming education were getting students used to laziness, being unable to answer some questions, or giving incomplete/incorrect answers, causing professional anxiety in students. Based on the results of the research, it can be said that it would be useful to integrate generative AI tools into programming courses considering the advantages they provide in programming teaching. However, appropriate measures should be taken regarding the limitations it brings. Based on the research findings, several recommendations were proposed regarding the integration of ChatGPT into lessons.",,Ramazan Yilmaz and Fatma Gizem {Karaoglan Yilmaz},,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chbah.2023.100005,,,,2949-8821,Computers in Human Behavior: Artificial Humans,"Generative artificial intelligence, ChatGPT, Programming, Programming learning, Student opinions",,2,100005,,,Augmented intelligence in programming learning: Examining student views on the use of ChatGPT for programming learning,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949882123000051,1,2023
article,YUKSEL2025100890,"This study aims to examine the effects of educational robotics activities on students’ 21st century skills. In the study, explanatory mixed method design was used. As a quantitative data collection tool, the 21st century skills scale was utilized [47]. In addition to quantitative data, qualitative data were collected from the teachers and students through semi-structured interviews. Within the scope of the research, students participated in robotic design courses with Arduino over the learning management system for ten weeks and participated in a competition with their products at the end of the activity. The activity was held with the participation of 62 students and 10 teachers. The findings of the study showed that educational robotic activities caused a significant increase in the affective domain of the students. While it did not cause any significant increase in the cognitive and sociocultural domains, the average scores of students increased on post-tests compared to the pretests for these two domains. In addition, students’ 21st century skills did not differ according to gender. Although there is no statistically significant difference in pretest–posttest results due to grade level, an increase was observed in posttest averages at each grade level. The observed increase in the post-tests, although not statistical, reveals the positive effect of educational robotic coding in terms of students’ 21st century skills. To support the results of the quantitative data, the analysis of the qualitative data revealed a consensus of both teachers and students on the contribution of such applications to the advancement of contemporary skills. In conclusion, the results of this study show that educational robotic coding can be used to develop 21st century skills of elementary school students.",,Akça Okan Yüksel and Bilal Atasoy and Selçuk Özdemir,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.entcom.2024.100890,,,,1875-9521,Entertainment Computing,"21st century skills, Educational robotics coding, Elementary school students, Sociocultural, Cognitive, Affective",,,100890,,,Transformation of labor: Educational robotics coding in elementary schools for 21st century skills,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875952124002581,52,2025
article,LIU2024104393,"Collaborative programming is being increasingly used to overcome the difficulties of the individual programming process. In this study, we investigated the effect of collaborative perception on cognitive engagement and learning outcomes in collaborative programming. We used a quasi-experimental research to determine the differences in cognitive engagement and learning outcomes of three groups with different levels of collaborative perception. The findings highlight several important conclusions. First, there were significant differences in cognitive engagement and learning outcomes across collaborative perception groups. Students with high levels of collaborative perception demonstrate more comprehensive and diverse cognitive engagement, resulting in higher learning outcomes compared to those with lower perception. Second, students in the low collaborative perception group had more Clarification-Elaboration cognitive connections, and students in the high collaborative perception group had stronger Clarification-Positioning and Clarification-Verification cognitive connections. Third, collaborative perception positively moderated the relationship between cognitive engagement and learning outcomes. In particular, three cognitive engagement, Clarification, Elaboration, and Positioning, had a greater impact on performance when moderated by collaborative perceptions. These findings have practical implications for educators and course designers, emphasizing the importance of considering students' collaborative perception when forming groups and promoting effective collaborative programming.",,Zhi Liu and Ya Gao and Yuqin Yang and Xi Kong and Liang Zhao,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2024.104393,,,,0001-6918,Acta Psychologica,"Students' perceptions of collaboration, Cognitive engagement, Epistemic network analysis, Learning outcomes, Collaborative programming",,,104393,,,Exploring the influence of students' perceptions of face-to-face collaboration on cognitive engagement and learning outcomes in collaborative programming,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691824002701,248,2024
article,SAMSUNDER2023105498,"Background
Concerns around accuracy and performance of rapid antigen tests continue to be raised with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Objective
To evaluate the performance of two widely used SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests during BA.4/BA.5 SARS-CoV-2 wave in South Africa (May – June 2022).
Study design
A prospective field evaluation compared the SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid test from Hangzhou AllTest Biotech (nasal swab) and the Standard Q COVID-19 Rapid Antigen test from SD Biosensor (nasopharyngeal swab) to the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay (nasopharyngeal swab) on samples collected from 540 study participants.
Results
Overall 28.52% (154/540) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive with median cycle number value of 12.30 (IQR 9.30–19.40). Out of the 99 successfully sequenced SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, 18 were classified as BA.4 and 56 were classified as BA.5. The overall sensitivities of the AllTest SARS-CoV-2 Ag test and Standard Q COVID-19 Ag test were 73.38% (95% CI 65.89–79.73) and 74.03% (95% CI 66.58–80.31) and their specificities were 97.41% (95% CI 95.30–98.59) and 99.22% (95% CI 97.74–99.74) respectively. Sensitivity was >90% when the cycle number value was <20. The sensitivity of both rapid tests was >90% in samples infected with Omicron sub-lineage BA.4 and BA.5.

article,AZEKA2022e10517,"The lack of relevant and disaggregated data about schools is a challenge for organizations implementing and funders looking to invest in kindergarten through 12th-grade education programs in New York City (NYC), often forcing organizations to make critical programmatic and financial decisions with only partial or anecdotal information about schools and its existing efforts. Over the last two years, an institution of higher education and a private foundation worked together to address this problem by indexing text in thousands of annual school reports and combining multiple open data sets about schools, including geography, demographics, and academic performance, into a single database. The initial use case focused on understanding the existing computing education efforts in NYC. However, seeing the potential to inform a broader set of questions, the collaborators began exploring the utility of such data with program officers at the foundation. Interviews of program officers around their programmatic needs and challenges illuminated their struggles with analyzing scattered data, difficulty accessing non-academic data and the need for disaggregated and geographical data.

article,CHENG2023100171,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a transformative force across diverse sectors worldwide, with policy initiatives signalling its rising prominence. In the realm of education, AI holds promise for revolutionising learning and teaching. However, the incorporation of AI in basic education faces significant challenges for many schools, particularly when explicit curriculum guidelines are absent, and teachers have limited exposure to AI technologies. This study delves into the importance of integrating Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), particularly in primary and secondary school settings, with a specific emphasis on the obstacles and facilitators. The research examines the impact of digital leadership and its role in mitigating teachers' barriers to AIED incorporations. These external variables are systematically outlined within the conceptual framework proposed by this study. Furthermore, it conceptualises and considers three AIED approaches—Learning from AI, Learning about AI, and Learning with AI—as internal variables central to basic-education AIED incorporations, as highlighted in previous research. The study gathers quantitative data through a self-constructed questionnaire survey from 204 school principals and management-level teachers across 60 primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong, capturing their perceptions of AIED incorporation. A structural equation model (SEM) is adopted to analyse the relationships between digital leadership, internal and external teacher barriers, and the three AIED approaches. The findings underscore that digital leadership is a significant factor in facilitating AI incorporations in schools, and that teachers' internal and external barriers considerably affect Learning about AI. The paper concludes by proposing strategies to enhance the capabilities of school leaders and teachers in promoting AIED in basic education.",,Eric Chi Keung Cheng and Tianchong Wang,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2023.100171,,,,2666-920X,Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence,"Digital leadership, Teachers' barriers to change, Artificial intelligence in education, AIED",,,100171,,,Leading digital transformation and eliminating barriers for teachers to incorporate artificial intelligence in basic education in Hong Kong,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X23000504,5,2023

article,GILES20221,"Background
Snakebite victims are commonly seen in KwaZulu-Natal Hospitals, with only a minority of patients requiring antivenom. This study reviewed antivenom-associated adverse events at our institution, after administration of the South African Vaccine Producers (SAVP) polyvalent antivenom.
Methods
A retrospective review, over 52 months (January 2016–April 2020), of patients who received antivenom. Demographics, clinical details and clinical course following antivenom administration were analysed.
Results
Emergency department doctors treated 758 snakebites; 156 patients were admitted of which 51 (33%) received antivenom. Indications for antivenom included: neurotoxicity (24%), haemotoxicity (18%) and significant cytotoxicity (58%). Antivenom-associated adverse events occurred in 61% of patients; with 47% developing anaphylaxis requiring adrenaline infusion. There was a higher incidence of anaphylaxis in children (57%) than in adults (40%), p = 0.55. There was no association between antivenom dose and anaphylaxis. No benefit was noted with adrenaline premedication (p = 0.64), nor with the addition of antihistamine or steroid pre-medicants to adrenaline (p = 0.61). Multivariable logistic regression identified age as a predictor for anaphylaxis, but not dose or duration of antivenom and not any particular form of premedication. Intubation was required in 29% of patients developing anaphylaxis. There were no deaths and all patients made full recovery.
Conclusion
Almost half of the patients at Ngwelezana hospital in Kwazulu-Natal receiving the SAVP polyvalent antivenom developed anaphylaxis requiring adrenaline infusion, with children at higher risk. The administration of this antivenom must only be given for valid indications, in a high-care environment by medical personnel ready to manage anaphylactic shock.

article,WOLFENGAGEN20229,"Computational activity is now recognized as a natural science, and computational and information processes have been discovered in the deep structures of many areas. Computations in the natural world were present long before the invention of computers, but a remarkable shift in understanding its fundamental nature occurs, in fact, before our eyes. The present moment, in fact, is a transition from the concept of computer science as an artificial science to the understanding that information processes are abundant in nature. Computing is recognized as a natural science that studies natural and artificial information processes. In everyday computing, operations are performed on the individual generators, with little attention paid to their internal structure. However, many common operations consist of more primitive constructions connected by a combination mode. The interaction of information processes and corresponding structures is carried out in an environment of “applicative interaction”, their applications to each other, and the study of the properties of this environment allows us to understand the nature of the computations. In the present work, the main attention is paid to elucidating the technological features of computations with individual generators, or objects. Their interaction is considered in an applicative environment, which allows us to elucidate the internal structure of ordinary operations, the knowledge of which allows us to understand their properties. The choice of initial constant generators, considered as generic ones and expressed by combinators, is discussed. These initial generators are used as the main “building blocks” that occur within the larger blocks of the applicative environment in interaction with each other. As a result of the interaction, constructions arise that give representative sets of ordinary operators and embedded computing systems.",,Viacheslav Wolfengagen and Larisa Ismailova and Sergey Kosikov,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogsys.2021.10.001,,,,1389-0417,Cognitive Systems Research,"Combinatory logic, Combinator-as-a-process, Information process, Applicative structure, Artificial computing, Natural computing",,,9-23,,,Cognitive technology to capture deep computational concepts with combinators,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389041721000747,71,2022
