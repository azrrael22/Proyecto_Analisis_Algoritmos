The two problems that characterize the modern psychology of thinking are mental representation and mental computation. Throughout the history of psychology, there has been an agreement that the essential features of a problem are that an organism has a goal but lacks a clear or well-learned route to the goal. Thus the emphasis in research on problem solving has been on response discovery—how the organism arrives at an effective, goal-attaining behavior. There have often been controversies over the role of learning or past experiences in problem solving. This chapter illustrates the conflict between emphases on learning and emphases on perception as central components of problem solving. Because a problem solver must find a solution, it might seem inevitable that an essential activity tries different approaches makes errors until the right approach is found. Earlier in problem-solving research, trial and error became associated with the view that acquiring a solution was a gradual, undirected process that did not involve perception or comprehension of problem requirements or structure.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the causes of memory interference and the extent of situations in which these mechanisms operate. First, the chapter discusses some widely held assumptions about the situation of interference, focusing on the idea that such effects arise from competition for access via a shared retrieval cue. This notion is sufficiently general that it may be applied in a variety of interference settings, which is illustrated briefly. Then the classical interference paradigms from which these ideas emerged are reviewed. The chapter also reviews more recent phenomena that both support and challenge classical conceptions of interference. These phenomena provide compelling illustrations of the generality of interference and, consequently, of the importance of understanding its mechanisms. A recent perspective on interference is highlighted that builds upon insights from modern work, while validating intuitions underlying several of the classical interference mechanisms. According to this new perspective, forgetting derives not from acquiring new memories per se, but from the impact of later retrievals of the newly learned material. After discussing findings from several paradigms that support this retrieval-based view, the chapter illustrates how forgetting might be linked to inhibitory processes underlying selective attention.}

abstract = {For children to yield greater mental performance abilities in real world settings, training approaches should offer practice in problems which have an affective component requiring social interactions, and be motivating over a sustained period. Current cognitive training games often overlook the important relationship between cognition and emotion, characterised by ‘hot executive function’, and correlated with fundamental academic and life outcomes. Here, we present robust qualitative evidence from a case study which documents the social relationships, motivation and engagement of a class of ten-year-old children who used an active smartphone cognitive training game called BrainQuest in their physical education lessons over a period of 5 weeks. Game design elements which are intended to move beyond simple gamification of cognitive tests are presented, along with a discussion of how these design elements worked in practice. The paper also presents and discusses the impact of the game upon the cognitive and emotional regulatory skills, characterised by executive function skills, based on the findings of this initial work. We conclude with recommendations for the designers of cognitive training games in the future and discussion of appropriate research methods for future gamification studies.}

This chapter is an attempt to clear the names of artificial intelligence (AI) and computational cognitive science. These two related disciplines have been accused of a conceptual error so profound that their very existence is jeopardized. Sometimes, however, philosophers successfully arrest and lock up the guilty. The best example of this, ironically, is in psychology. Artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science are both committed to the claim that computers can think. The former is committed to the claim that human-made computers can think, while computational cognitive science is committed to the view that naturally occurring computers, brains, think. AI is the field dedicated to building intelligent computers. AI ultimately wants a machine that could solve very difficult, novel problems like proving Fermat's last theorem, correcting the greenhouse effect, or figuring out the fundamental structure of space-time. Historically, AI is associated with computer science, but the compleat AI researcher frequently knows a fair amount of psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, mathematics, and possibly some other discipline.}

abstract = {Radiation hardening, also known as “rad hardening,” and radiation survivability testing are of critical importance to defense, aerospace, and energy industries. Everyone knows that excessive exposure to radiation can cause severe damage to living things, but high radiation levels can also cause radiation damage to other objects, especially electronics. Ionizing radiation in particular, including directly ionizing radiation such as alpha and beta particles and indirectly ionizing radiation such as gamma rays and neutron radiation, is profoundly damaging to the semiconductors that make up the backbone of all modern electronics. Just one charged particle can interfere with thousands of electrons, causing signal noise, disrupting digital circuits, and even causing permanent physical radiation damage. Radiation hardening involves designing radiation-tolerant electronics and components that are tolerant of the massive levels of ionizing radiation, such as cosmic outer space radiation, X-ray radiation in medical or security environments, and high energy radiation within nuclear power plants. In order to test these components and determine whether they are sufficiently hardened, radiation-hardened electronics manufacturers perform rigorous testing as part of their product manufacturing processes. Components which pass these tests go into production and can be described as “radiation-hardened”; components that do not go back to design.}

We can develop precise accounts of cognitive processes that, although they involve more than computing, can still be modelled on the machines we call ‘computers’. In this paper, I want to suggest some ways that this might be done, using ideas from the mathematical theory of uncomputability (or Recursion Theory). And I want to suggest some uses to which the resulting models might be put.

Les éléments du raisonnement ne relevant pas du calculable (uncomputable), (s'il en existe), peuvent s'etudier dans I'optique suggérée par Turing (1950) pour l'étude des éléments calculables (computable). On peut rendre compte avec précision des processus cognitifs qui, bien qu'impliquant plus que des calculs, peuvent cependant être modélisés sur ordinateurs. Dans cet article l'auteur propose des modalités pour arriver à ces résultats en utilisant les idées de la théorie mathdmatique de la Récursion (uncomputability). L'auteur suggère aussi des utilisations pour les modéles que en découlent (Il est possible au lecteur plus intéressé par les modèles et leurs utilisations que par les mathématiques et les théorèmes de passer rapidement sur la partie mathématique ou d'omettre de la lire.)}

This chapter introduces the research that done at the University of South Florida to determine the biocompatibility of single-crystal SiC and related materials with neuronal and glial cells to determine whether they are possible candidate materials for the construction of a neuronal implantation device. It describes the basics about the CNS, how it is organized, and its major cellular constituents are described and their purposes within the CNS. Following this, it considers the research investigating the in vitro biocompatibility of 3C-SiC and a related material, nanocrystalline diamond (NCD), with immortalized neuronal and CNS cell lines. The in vitro reaction of primary derived neurons with 3C-SiC is also detailed, followed by initial in vivo testing of 3C-SiC within the brain of a wild-type mouse. The central nervous system (CNS) is composed of the brain and spinal cord. Blood is not in direct contact with the extracellular fluid within the CNS because of restrictive endothelial cells that create a tight junction known as the blood–brain barrier. Any physical biomedical device that would interact with the CNS has to deal with cells that perform functions similar to their leukocyte counterparts found within the bloodstream. The therapeutic utility provided by these devices is that they could be utilized as a platform for drug delivery behind the blood–brain barrier to specific CNS areas, or to transport neuronal factors or even other cells to the CNS to assist in the repair of the neural system damaged by trauma and disease.}
